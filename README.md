# Introduction  
The Reddit Stock Sentiment Analysis project is designed to scrape Reddit comments related to various stocks, perform sentiment analysis using a machine learning program, and then visualize the sentiment results. This project aims to provide insights into the overall sentiment of Reddit users towards specific stocks, helping investors and traders gauge public sentiment.
# Demo
I am working on a live demo that streams real-time sentiment values for the stocks. The real-time streaming isn't active yet but will be very soon. However, plots for historic values of the sentiment of the stocks are available in the live demo. Please note that it may take upto 2 minutes to render the webpage due to renders restrictions.
