I just compared a search for specific trim years of the Tesla M3 and BMW 5 Series: car gurus vs carvana and prices were not what I expected. I've heard cvna is like $3K over average dealer prices. I was seeing $5-9K over average. 

That's a lot of insurance premium to pay to be able to return a car within the first week if you don't like it. 

On top of that, the trims for the Tesla were $10K more expensive than a brand new one with the IRA tax credit. 

The return policy is IMO CNVA's major edge. I don't see it being economical for more than $3,000 extra.",577,Tesla ,1

That component is the Driver Monitoring System that ensures the driver is paying attention. Its main listing in London, although it's HQ is in Australia. It's due to give a trading update for the full-year on 22nd August, which I expect to be very positive.

Not only does it provide driver monitoring to BMW (all future models), Stellantis, GM, Ford (Mach-e, F150), Mercedes (S, EQS) and Volkswagen but it is partnered with Qualcomm and Magna. In addition, it is partnered with Collins Aerospace (part of Raytheon) to put its eye-tracking tech into aeroplanes and aircraft simulators.

I think it will go up multiples over the next few months and am invested in it. You should do your own research of course. To help you do that I've included links below to its website and a blog that discusses it:

The probability of a recession in the United States in 2023 has been the subject of much debate among economists. In December 2022, a survey of economists by the National Association for Business Economics found that 58% of respondents expected a recession to occur in 2023. However, in recent months, some economists have revised their forecasts, suggesting that a recession is less likely.

In June 2023, the Conference Board, a business research group, lowered its probability of a recession in 2023 to 25%. The Conference Board cited a number of factors for its revised forecast, including strong job growth and consumer spending.

The Federal Reserve is also playing a role in the debate over the likelihood of a recession. In an effort to combat inflation, the Fed has raised interest rates several times in recent months. This has led to concerns that the Fed could raise rates too quickly and slow the economy too much, which could trigger a recession.

It is still too early to say whether or not the United States will experience a recession in 2023. The economy is facing a number of headwinds, but there are also some positive signs. The Federal Reserve will be closely monitoring the economy and will adjust its policies as needed.

According to my analysis of my knowledge, there is a 50% chance of a recession in the United States in 2023. The probability of a recession increases to 95% by late July 2024. However, it is important to note that this is just a prediction, and the actual outcome could be different.",1552,Google ,1

Guys this world of trading is fractal. The vast majority of people do not know or understand why. If you open Tr@ding view in Nvidia week time frame. You will see an institutional candle. To continue rising the market has to go down and cover part of the institutional candlestick, because in the institutional candlesticks there are open short orders that must be closed or they simply take all the liquidity and close their orders. That way the institutions earn millions and return to their initial investment intact. Guys i recommend to sell. In the photo of the chart you will see the large circle is the institutional candle. Small circle is an imbalance which means that the market will reach it.",831,Nvidia ,0

17571,1563yfz,"Critical Recession Update: We Just Entered into the +/-1 Sigma Birthing Zone, the Cradle of Recessions (Key Takeaways Below)",2023-07-21,"I‚Äôll tell you why this will never happen. For the simple reason that there are way way too many people who missed this rally who would love to get in now at much lower prices so the market won‚Äôt allow them. There‚Äôs just way too much cash sitting on the sidelines. This reads like a backward engineered story to make people believe they‚Äôve been right all along and to wait for lower prices.

People are now acting like the soft landing idea is consensus so it‚Äôs somehow contrarian to believe we‚Äôll now get a hard landing. This is one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve ever heard and I heard a professional money manager proposing this on national television just a few days ago. Imagine thinking that something almost nobody believed was possible like two months ago is now consensus and the market is fully priced for it. Absolute regard level thinking there. Markets take years to get over stretched after news finally looks okay. The best gains though are made when news goes from terrible to okay. Few understand this.

I‚Äôve been following the markets closely for about 11 years where I feel like I can remember where sentiment was at various times of excess and I don‚Äôt care what the fear and greed charts that get passed around say- this is the most hated rally I‚Äôve ever seen including the one after the covid crash. People simply cannot accept that stocks are going up when there‚Äôs ‚Äúsupposed to be‚Äù a major recession.

I suspect the most likely outcome from here is that the high fliers digest their gains for a while and it doesn‚Äôt turn into a major bubble with an actual blow off top. By the way blow off tops look nothing like this. They are market-wide where the entire market moves higher (not just large cap stocks) then when cash levels are low because everyone is fully invested and leveraged to the tits, it narrows into a handful of stocks. This year has been a catch back of the former leaders after a soft landing began getting priced in around the beginning of the year. Also, a month or so ago Nvidia dropped from $450 to $400. This week Netflix dropped from $480 to $430 on very good earnings. A 10% correction in two sessions that almost nobody seemed to notice. Those aren‚Äôt real corrections according to the bears because they‚Äôre expecting a major rout across the market so they‚Äôll continue to miss out.",2321,Nvidia ,0

well this is the other side of the slope, tsla will pop up 3,4,or5 then we are headed back down the mountain or anything goes cause that will be then end of move they played.

Like other have said, this bull will have to face reality at some point. It‚Äôs more a matter of if you can make shorter term plays before then, or find the top and ride it down. Generally and historically speaking stocks fall much faster than they rise, unless we finally face the depression that‚Äôs waiting on the other side, I have a feeling most stocks like Tesla will see a bumpy ride down with glimpses of actual catalysts for a move back up as the market overall finds fair value. 

The random 9% movements, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs anything to cling too nor do I think this market gives a shit about technicals. Sure it can ride lines and MA‚Äôs but all it takes is one time that someone with deeper pockets needs xyz to happen, and the technicals are out the window.",940,Tesla ,1

Only a few realize the amazing evolution that this business has had

&#x200B;

>""*Stocks are not Lottery Tickets, you have a Company (Business!) behind Stock, if the company does well the stock will do well*"" - Peter Lynch

Tesla in his Industry is a company that has left its Competitors (*peers*) on the ground, and not precisely cuz it generates more Revenues. 

It's cuz the Business is much cheaper and more efficient with a level of leverage much lower than that of its competitors, and with good Quality Product. *Have you driven a Tesla? :D*

**TSLA Total Debt to Equity Ratio is 4.4%, an his Long Term Debt is 1.6%**

**Most of their Peers have 100% or more (*****Leveraged Business*****) Debt to Equity Ratio**

Money knew central banks were trying to inflate.. they dumped (and borrowed to the hilt) trillions into assets to protect themselves from the coming inflation.  Stock buybacks and real estate are 2 prime examples.  Look at the explosion of corporate landlords.

These prices rose.. owners of these assets felt wealthier.. the herd followed suit and bought into the frenzy.. everyone and their grandmother started owning AirBnbs and other investment properties  It was tulip mania all over again.. the roaring 20's.

The shortage probably is real.   There are alot of properties just sitting around hedging inflation.. could be owned by Chinese businessmen.. Russian oligarchs.. who knows.. it was a global gold rush.

Would I say property, stocks, art, other assets are in a bubble?   I could say with 100% certainty stocks and real estate is.   AirBnb's are now more expensive than hotels.. rental units are over 100% avg local incomes in many places.. globally.   But now the fog is starting to clear.  Money supply is being contracted, layoffs are picking up, businesses are folding, consumers getting squeezed, workers are just absolutely hammered into the dust.. and Boomers are starting to die out of their homes en masse.

This explains 40% increases in house prices since 2019.. this explains rental explosions and how most jobs became unprofitable to work.

What good is an investment in anything that yields +% if you're spending -% on debt? Little Johnny has $1000 in cc debt at 29.99% interest, but he invests $1000 in stock that yields 10%. Little Johnny now has 19.99 interest rate, but that's compounding, so he's losing his $1000 investment on a daily basis. So there's rule 1, get out of debt. Things like a real estate mortgage are a necessary debt for most folks who want ""the american dream"" but you must know, the real dream is being free to travel, buy, and do whatever you wish. As long as you have debt, you're not free. If you're a renter, you're paying 100% interest rate.

The second thing you do is stop buying what you don't need. Seriously, a look back at your life from a hospital bed or a city park bench as you feed the pigeons will yield glimpses of the stuff you owned and the stuff that owned you, or the things you ""got"" to collect and share with others and enjoyed that didn't hold you down along the way. If you're a gamer, turn your game hobby into investing. Learn short trading. Spend that time investing, then at the gym. Leave the gaming behind and ""level up"" your personal finances. Pass up a cup of coffee in the coffee shop. If you have a Schwab account, you can buy fractional shares of SPY products for $5 min increments. A cup of overpriced coffee can also buy you $5 worth of tsla, tsll, etc. Me personally, a glass of water as I watch my $5 grow is worth a hell of a lot more.

And if you feel like gambling, which is literally all the market really is, gamble $100 on some inverse leveraged stocks like SQQQ, DUST, or REW. When (not if) the market flips negative, these historically shoot to the moon. Don't put all your eggs in this basket, it will Enron you if you're not careful.

This phenomenon was beautifully captured in a 1998 article for Red Herring magazine called ""Why Most Economists' Predictions Are Wrong."" It was written by Paul Krugman, himself an economist, who went on to win the Nobel Prize. Krugman points out that too many economists' predictions fail because the overestimate the impact of future technologies, and then he makes a few predictions of his own. Here's one: ""The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in 'Metcalfe's law' ‚Äî which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants ‚Äî becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other!

using image recognition (google machine learning; neuronal network) you can first collect a database of basically just screenshots of stock trajectories cut off at a certain point of ""decision"". and then add the value of: went up after or went down after.

I built a Neuronal Network that way. I can feed it an image of any stock and it hands me a probability (%) of that stock going up. It works better if the screenshot is taken from the same stock screener so its easily recognized. My original idea was to test this for a while with monopoly money until I had a good system aka: 60-80% 5k investment; 80-90% 10k... and the same for puts in the lower %. i did this with daily charts and my monopoly money investments were sold at close of the same day for the experiment.  

unfortunately the tool did not work in this simple manner. Maybe it would work if i also let it analyze time frame of the investment i.e. the time the upturn lasted. but i dont feel like going through the thousands of screenshots again.

A lot of people talk about how AI is going to change the landscape for a lot of things and they may be right. But one thing that I know is that it WILL change the stock market as we understand it and it does not actually need to become that much 'smarter' for it to happen. 

While the economy is always variable and stonks rise and fall for a lot of reasons that can't be predicted by an AI model an AI model can be used to more accurately respond and function than a human ever could. 

Once AI can take in the 'big picture' of the stonks and then start targeted investment and capitalization to manipulate the market as a whole we will see a fundamental shift.

62672,1575qms,Tesla Starts Offering 84-Month Loans as Interest Rates Rise,2023-07-23,"Article:

Tesla Inc. has started offering  consumers 84-month auto loans after Elon Musk said the carmaker would  ‚Äúhave to do something‚Äù about rising interest rates. The company now  includes seven-year loans as an option on its US order pages, after  previously offering loans as long as 72 months. While extending loan  terms can lower car buyers‚Äô monthly payments, consumers tend to pay more  in interest and face greater risk of owing more than their vehicle is  worth.

Tesla‚Äôs chief executive  officer has been a frequent critic of the Federal Reserve. Musk tweeted  in November that the central bank‚Äôs rate increases were ‚Äúmassively  amplifying the probability of a severe recession.‚Äù His predictions of  impending deflation haven‚Äôt yet panned out.‚ÄúWhen interest rates rise  dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car, because  the interest payments increase the price of the car,‚Äù Musk said during  Tesla‚Äôs July 19 earnings call. ‚ÄúSo we have to do something about that.‚Äù

While  84-month auto loans have been gaining in popularity, the trend slowed  early this year, according to credit-reporting company Experian. Roughly  34% of new vehicles loans in the first quarter were longer than six  years, down from about 38% a year ago. Tesla delivered a record 466,140  vehicles during the three months that ended in June but has sold fewer  cars than it‚Äôs produced each of the last five quarters. The shares  plunged after Musk said on this week‚Äôs call that the company will have  to keep lowering prices if interest rates continue to rise.",1564,Tesla ,1

31264,158d944,When the word recession peaks its about 12 months later that it actually happens (the second peak),2023-07-24,"People see the events that are LIKELY to lead to a recession all the time.  More people notice them as the system is more likely to break.  They're easy to see before a recession.  The problem is timing.  

It's like putting too much weight on a bridge.  Everyone sees the weight go over the bridges limit. That's the safety limit, not the break now limit.  No one knows when it breaks, it's just somewhere in the not safe territory.  If you're in the business of betting when the bridge breaks you start looking for signs the bridge is gonna break when it's over that limit.

The stock market is the same way.  People start googling and looking to recessions when safe limits and warning signs are appearing.  After a period of time with no break over the safe limit, people start to get complacent and not trust the limit.  This is unwise, but usual behavior. People see it's past the danger line, but hasn't broken yet and stop trusting the danger line not understanding what it actually means.

It doesn't mean imminent failure, it means you're past the point where failure is extremely unlikely.  After a while people get used to this, then start to act like it's not a problem and stop actively figuring out if problems are imminent while they're still past the safety zone. The system can entirely recover back into safe territory without a break at this point, but each additional danger sign is like an additional sign that the bridge is moving toward being less and less likely to make it out of the situation without permanent damage. Also note that not all damage is a collapse, you can just be stuck repairing the damage to bridge with a catastrophe/collapse too.",1676,Google ,0

Spotify is not the streaming service gold standard, but they have maintained a very consistant quality of service and convenience which has made my music listening experience so much easier. 

They told me exactly when and by how much my Spotify bill was going to increase each month with a giant banner that came up when I opened the app. I really appreciated that.

People saw how little spotify gave to artists, and they responded by giving artists tools in the app that allows their fans to contribute directly to them, either by donating or buying merchandise.

AND I pick up EXACTLY where I left off on any device where I am signed in?

Yea it aint perfect. But they can take my 11 dollars because streaming is expensive to maintain and I dont trust my money with Apple or Amazon for the same service.

It's a chance to take a step back, eat a slice of humble pie, and admit to yourself you're regarded. Look at all the time and research you put into making this magnificent post only for you and those you influenced to have lost money. I wish I could say it's surprising, but here's a little secret - you don't know jack shit about options trading and you know even less about the market. Odds are you probably never will because the stock market is hyper-efficient and no single or even group of online retail traders is going to outsmart it. You can write as much ""DD"" as you want, but at the end of the day, you're only talking yourself and others into losing money because **nobody who browses and posts on a public online forum is going to outsmart the market.** Even if everything you wrote is true, it's already priced in. You're not some genius for reading earnings reports and sticking your finger in your ass to gauge the economic headwind. 

So sit back, eat a nice happy meal, and take solace in your ignorance and knowing that you are a complete regard.

Saw that happen in mid-00s and in 2013-2015 and again in mid-2020 to early 2021.

Probably has to do with Google being the best cyclical representative (ad revenue is 80+% of the business), so we could be approaching one of those ""high cyclical"" moments where we get a massive greed fueled/risk on boom outside of AAPL/MSFT.

I think there's a good chance that we see another one of those periods over the next 6-8 months where Google massively outperforms AAPL/MSFT in a catch up trade (and everything high risk, i.e. small caps/meme stocks/etc. joins).",785,Apple Google Microsoft ,1

I don't think Elon is that dumb, but when I see him writing letters about the risk of AI becoming too smart, he either is creating false hype or he genuinely is stupid and doesn't understand how AI works. We are nowhere near Artificial General Intelligence. So far away that we haven't even defined it clearly nor do we remotely know how to achieve it. We do not even know how human intelligence works.

**TL;DR** = $TLRY above $2.50 (USD) by August 18, 2023 and above $5.00 (USD) by January 19, 2024... that's what the UOA Unusual Options Activity is saying!!!

\-------------

6 days ago on August 20th there was a very interesting (bullish) option trade combo: Selling puts and buying calls.

""$TLRY Bullish Risk Reversal

OPENING 08/18 $2.50 CALLS ($98,000)

WRITING 08/18 $2.5 PUTS ($1,220,000)

ER 07/26""

[https://twitter.com/FLOWrensics\_/status/1682069383735132180](https://twitter.com/FLOWrensics_/status/1682069383735132180)

TL;DR someone sold $1.22 Million in put option premium, meaning if $TLRY's stock is below $2.50 (USD) they will be forced to buy (""put"") shares to them at a cost of \[14,000\] shares x \[100 lots\] if it's not above $2.50 by August 18, 2023.

They then bought some calls.

Today before earning, $TLRY closed at $1.68... \[($2.50 - $1.68) / $1.68)\] = +48.8% move before August 18, 2023 expiry.

Take this with what you will... but didn't Carl CFO say positive free cash flow this quarter?

For what it's worth $TLRY still has Germany + debt convert on MedMen + distribution network and alcohol revenue in the USA (which they would just add THC into the drinks when USA is legal).

If earnings are good, maybe it will put a temporary bottom in the sector.

Even if you hate Canadian LP's and are mostly focused on USA MSO's, having a bullish reaction to $TLRY's earning would be positive to the sector overall.

What's everyone's thoughts? Yes there is dilution, but $TLRY is highly shorted along with the sector, so it is possible to have a temporary short term squeeze.

Then yesterday, then yesterday, someone (maybe the same institution) was doing bullish put option selling worth $560,000 over 8 orders on the $TLRY January 2024 $5.00 strike puts at 3:42pm...

For the first time in history, companies locked in low interest rates by taking out long term loans. 80% of corp debt is low interest and long term. It is actually making the Fed rate hikes less effective at bringing down inflation. It is also a major reason we haven't slipped into recession yet and/or have had big layoffs. Now who knows how it will play out. Those loans mature in 2025, 26, 27. The Fed may have to go much longer and maybe higher to get core to 2%, or God knows what else. But this is really different this time.

31086,15a63ct,Why is DISH crumbling?,2023-07-26,"I bought a little bit of Dish, only 100 shares. I'll probably keep adding to that position if it keeps going down and just hold. Basically taking a flyer on it because it's so down. But it's a VERY long term play. I don't see this as a short term play at all. This is more of a 3-5 year play in my view. Satellite TV is a dying business, and there really isn't much of a future there. The long term play is their 5G network and spectrum holdings. Basically my thought is their future is really as a 5G/wireless company, rather than a satellite TV company. If their wireless rollout goes well and they can monetize it quickly, there's good upside potential. If it doesn't go well, they have a shitload of 5G spectrum assets they can sell in 2026 or lead to them getting acquired by someone, so there's some downside protection too. I don't see a legitimate reason why Amazon would acquire them. Verizon seems like a much more likely buyer to get their hands on the 5G spectrum assets, but that can't happen until 2026. If you use Fidelity go look at their Trefis valuation. Lots of good details there.

TLDR: DISH seems more like a long term play, betting on their future as a player in 5G and mobile or cashing in on the significant spectrum assets they have. It's risky and might not work out for me, but I think the upside potential is enough for me to throw a little bit of money into it. It's a play that requires a lot of patience, so not really what I think most people here are looking for.",1497,Amazon ,1

Second of all, if Dish is giving customers cheap or possibly free service to Amazon Prime customers, that means they're getting a piece of Amazon's $140/year Prime pie.

$14 a month is hardly enough for phone service on its own. I doubt Amazon is going to give Dish more than $1 - $2 of that.

Third of all, Dish took this deal because they're struggling badly. Verizon and T-Mobile probably laughed at Amazon for even asking to offer free service in exchange for a portion of Prime revenue.

31143,15a63ct,Why is DISH crumbling?,2023-07-26,"I posted this in dish dudes thread yesterday and got blasted for it. It answers your question though. To add some content now that we know more about the 'deal' Amazon is going to sell boost infinite like BestBuy sells all the carriers. Bestbuy makes cash on closing deals, so will amazon from Boost. it's probably like $100 a sign up for Amazon from dish and that's where this ""deal"" ends.


""Boost has always been on Amazon. Boost Infinite is not exclusive to Amazon, here is their Dish Wireless site https://www.boostinfinite.com/plans The $25 plan has been around awhile, but the older boost mobile family plans are arguably better. 3 lines at $100 each with a 30GB hotspot included.

When T-Mobile was allowed to buy Sprint, Sprint's MVNO Boost Mobile was to be given to Dish to make them the 4th player. Boost Mobile used sprint's network, but like all the others they would roam amongst networks if needed. Now that network is T-Mobile and the deal was Dish would get to use that network until they built their own.

There might be a deal here, but it's going to kill dish just like people think it would kill AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Big old race to the bottom to compete on price. Great for consumers, not great for the companies bottom line. Amazon has never been concerned about making money off retail and this is just an extension of that. Amazon does not want to maintain these wires, they want to force someone else to. Dish will take that spot and have to pay T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon when the Amazon Prime people roam and abuse the service to try and justify their membership pricing. Dish will be in no position to push back and will just have to pay.

TL;DR Sonny (Dish) asks Paulie (Amazon) to help him with the restaurant. Paulie does this favor for Sonny with favorable terms. Sonny can't pay Paulie and the Vendors (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile) While giving Paulie his cut. Paulie tells Sonny F*** You where's my money! and Paulie is paid.

WallStreetBets is popular on Reddit for a number of reasons, including:

* **Its focus on meme stocks.** WallStreetBets is known for its focus on ""meme stocks,"" which are stocks that are popular among retail investors and often have a high social media following. These stocks can be volatile and unpredictable, but they can also offer the potential for big gains.
* **Its sense of community.** WallStreetBets is a very active community, with users constantly sharing news, tips, and memes. This sense of community can be a great resource for new investors, and it can also be a lot of fun.
* **Its willingness to take risks.** WallStreetBets is not for the faint of heart. The subreddit's users are known for taking on high-risk investments, and they often have a ""YOLO"" (you only live once) attitude. This can be both exciting and risky, but it's also what makes WallStreetBets so popular.

In addition to these factors, WallStreetBets has also benefited from the recent rise of retail investing. As more and more people have started investing in stocks, WallStreetBets has become a go-to resource for information and advice.

Of course, WallStreetBets is not without its critics. Some people argue that the subreddit's users are too reckless and that they are gambling with their money. Others argue that WallStreetBets is a breeding ground for misinformation and that it can lead to people making bad investment decisions.

Despite these criticisms, WallStreetBets remains a popular subreddit. It is a place where people can come to learn about stocks, share ideas, and take on risks. Whether you agree with its methods or not, there is no denying that WallStreetBets is a force to be reckoned with.

Here are some additional details about WallStreetBets:

* The subreddit was founded in 2012 and has over 11 million members.
* The subreddit's name is a reference to the Wall Street financial district in New York City.
* The subreddit's users are often referred to as ""degenerates"" or ""autists.""
* The subreddit has been credited with helping to drive up the prices of meme stocks like GameStop and AMC.
* The subreddit has also been criticized for its promotion of risky investment strategies.

Overall, WallStreetBets is a unique and controversial subreddit that has had a significant impact on the stock market. Whether you love it or hate it, there is no denying that WallStreetBets is a force to be reckoned with.",2457,Google ,1

They have a network built covering 73% of the population. Problem is most of the network is still data only and voice isn't enabled yet as they have to light up Voice Switches across the country and then test them and optimize them. Boost Mobile offers a sim nicknamed  the"" rainbow sim"" and you can access the dish 5G network in 50+ markets where they have voice enabled (only a small amount of the 73% of Data coverage is also voice) When not in a Dish 5G area you will use either AT&T or T-Mobile depending on signal. Roaming is 40GB or 50GB depending on plan. Unlimited Plans available are $40 and $60 (single line cost)

Boost infinite has started to slowly rollout Dish 5G access in eligible areas.

Dish is still waiting on their 5G Network cerification for voice and data on Pixel and iPhone devices (iphone fully supports the dish network on the iphone 14 and later ) Currently they offer Samsung and Motorola devices as well as their Celero phone.

They offer a beta testing / early access to the dish 5G network through a truly unlimited 5G plan with unlimited hotspot and uncapped video through their ""Project Genesis"" Brand. The plan is $25/mo but requires a purchase of a $400 Motorola Edge Plus 2023 (half price flagship phone)

9777,15a9i7o,I made nearly 100k in 2 days. Please help me stop gambling,2023-07-26,"I will give you the best of both worlds. Take 75k of the 100k Invest in a twenty plus stock portfolio of monthly income funds. Psec,Main,O,Agnc,DX,pflt,ggn,prt,pba,govz, this is 10 of them for an example. Look up the best ones and diversify some REITs, some oil and gas, some metals. Some of my metal dividend payers are quarterly dividend which is fine as long as you are diversified a few of the stocks can pay quarterly with mostly monthly. This will pay you approx 6-7k a year in dividends on 75k so around 5-600 a month. Reinvest those dividends each time you can to keep growing your monthly payment. Eventually once you hit around 500k invested you will replace your W2 income. Use the other $25k to your liking. I would suggest diversifying even more, some in crypto, some in the otc, some in share lending platforms and others like ground floor.us. I would take that last 5-10k and use that for options. If you can't make more off the last 10k you wouldn't have made more using the 100k. Try as hard as you can to pick wisely, slowly and get that 10k to double. If you lose it, no more options. That is just my opinion as a monthly income expert everyone had their own methods of sustaining and creating wealth. Cheers!",1228,Meta ,1

69634,15apk5q,YOLO'd the entire mortgage FOMC week (After Market Wednesday UPDATE!),2023-07-27,"The rate at which people have been calling me a ""fucking idiot"" to my inbox has been slowing down, so I figured it would be a good time to do a quick update and answer some of the questions I keep getting over and over again:

1. Yes, I'm an idiot/crazy. I have serious dyslexia, unconscious/nervous tics (i'm twitchy), and ADHD. People started asking my parents if I was regarded from when I was 2, and by 1st grade I used to introduce myself ""Hi, I'm AttackSock, people think I'm regarded, but I'm just really weird. Please try to be patient with me."" At some point after an adulthood of alcoholism and self hate and depression, I decided to quit being ashamed and just lean into my unreliable chaotic-good alignment... So... may as well YOLO the mortgage.
2. This started off 2 months ago as a couple thousand worth of beer money I put into TSLA calls when the price was like $180/share (I had an alcohol related near death experience a year and a half ago and after getting out of the hospital I decided to quit drinking and put my normal alcohol spending into a separate saving account). I've lost $20,000 in a day more than once. If I fuck things up and lose the $5,000 deposit, or the $50,000 down payment, it's all just a bump in the road with money I wouldn't even have had if I kept drinking, and I may be dead by now anyway if I hadn't quit. What I decided is that since interest rates are like 7% now, I'd rather just buy the house with cash, so at the last minute rather than taking out a shitty loan I'm trying to quintuple my money.
3. An ""option"" means I paid some amount of money for the right to buy a block of 100 shares at whatever the shown ""strike price"" is. So, for the SECOND option listed it shows July 28 $265 call, Last Price $3.35, Price Paid $6.575, Quantity 4. What this means is that at close of business on July 28th, I'm allowed to buy 400 shares of Tesla for $265/share (I can actually do this at ANY time). Assuming the price is, say, $275/share at that time, I can immediately sell them for $275/share, making $10 per share. I originally paid $6.575/share for the privilege to do this (at 400 shares this is $2,630). So, if the price on July 28th is $275, I will make $10 minus the $6.575 = $3.425/share, which is $1,370 (52% profit). RIGHT NOW, I can sell those contracts for $3.35 per share (The ""Last Price""), which means I'm passing that right to whoever buys the contract. In order to ""break even"" the share price needs to be $265+$6.575=$271.575, and basically, I make anything above that or lose anything below that. However, if the price is below $265, there would be no reason to buy the shares, and the contract simply stops existing.
4. My life has been fucking chaos since very early on. I had a very boring typical traumatic childhood and was homeless for 4 years immediately after high school (like... sleeping on the street eating at the soup kitchen homeless). I'm sort of clever though and I worked really hard coming up with odd jobs (I used to get discarded library books and old textbooks and resell them on amazon via a laptop I traded a bag of weed for back in 2001). This mortgage YOLO situation is apparently very traumatic and unimaginable for a lot of you, but for me this is all just amusing.
5. No, I'm not afraid of ""losing everything"", I know I can keep moving forward. I would PREFER not to lose everything, but doing the ""conservative"" thing right now by NOT YOLOing the mortgage would mean taking on a 7% mortgage in the middle of a housing bubble, which is already a terrible fucking idea... so if this YOLO works out and I can buy the house with cash, or if this totally fucks up and I lose the deposit, either of those things might be better than buying a house on loan.

As far as ""how things are going"", the FOMC doesn't seem to have had a major impact in after hours. We had a little bump today and the calls were in the green, and as you can see I've rolled/diversified a bit and opened some puts early this morning just in case shit hit the fan with the FOMC (which actually is the worst loser in my portfolio right now). I'm prepared for a $20 move in either direction, more or less, but right now Theta is kicking my ass, so if things don't get moving by Friday I'm probably going to consolidate a bit and roll both the calls and the puts further in the money and cut down on the number of them (which generally lowers the impact of theta).

I generally know what I'm doing, but I still consider myself a noob at this, so not all of my moves make sense, but, you know, learn by doing!",4563,Tesla Amazon ,0

I am holding 522 $DISH shares @ 7.60.

I believe this stock will go up.   

The Short volume yesterday was 7 million which was more than double the volume the previous day. Normal short volume is 1 to 2 million. 

The only time it was more (9 million) was on 02jun2023 (Friday). the call options sellers were trying to keep the stock below $8 and they succeeded in doing that. so the options expired worthless.

the same thing happened yesterday. a certain hedge fund kept shorting the shares. The total short sales volume has gone down by 1 million. so lot of short have been closed but new shorts have also opened in order to keep the prices down.

the total share volume was 26m which was exactly double of the daily average. so there is a lot of interest in this stock.

I saw some tweets on twitter by Patrick comack, he seems pretty pissed by yesterday's development. he even named the hedge fund responsible for yesterday's dump and some other details (just search $dish on twitter).

I hope the stock does not fall below $7. there should be some PUT sellers who do not want the stock to hit $7 mark. This stock will probably ping pong between $7.10 to $ 7.45 so as to satisfy both the CAll and PUT Options sellers.

maybe tomorrow there will be more volatility in the stock price.",1372,Apple ,0

1. You can't just say something is a rug pull by spoOOoky hedgies and then refuse to elaborate further. I know that kind of jargon sells with the mouth breathing populist brain rotted apes but you need to provide some kind of evidence of someone intentionally selling you on an idea then taking profits before you can to show a rug pull. The only person who told US in this sub that DISH was going to moon was YOU. 
2. The play was not intelligent. Not only was it ultimately WRONG, but as some people noted the next day the deal has been publicly available knowledge since fucking MARCH. You came acting like you had discovered something about a shitty little company that would make it moon and in reality the information you had was publicly available information for months before you did your weird little ""amazon jobs at dish guys"" shtick. Your play wasnt good, you are indeed a regard. 
3. You made nobody money. You probably lost a lot of people money. I saw your original post and another post about DISH and even I, a pretty reasonable risk averse bro who only really comes here to shit on you morons, even I bought a call. I only bought one and my call was ITM, but i bought for 75 dollars and sold the next day for 24. So I lost 2/3rds of my ""investment"". Theres probably people in here that spent hundreds or even thousands of dollars on your shitty play. You can't cope here thinking you maybe did some good. You caused harm.
4. Furthermore you harmed your own goals. I mean you are such a degenerate you are gambling money for SPINAL SURGERY for your fucking S/O. Like maybe just do a normal investment with it bro, this get rich quick to pay for her surgery has actually played out contrary. You are further from the surgery today than you have been in the past year.

stop being a populist conspiracy theorist who thinks the hedgies are working 24/7 to get the 4k from your robinhood account, they literaelly dont give a fuck. stop gambling with your gf spine surgery money. stop coping that you  maybe did a good deed, you didnt you hurt people with your bad info. stop blaming hedgies for your shitty calls. stop thinking you are smarter than the market, you arent. they are far more well researched and educated about these things than you are. stop thinking you can get rich quick your way to fixing all your problems. you can't, youre a degenerate gambler.

I think DISH is a good pick, but to me it's more of a long term value play than a short term yolo. I bought earlier this week too. Only 100 shares (~$750), but will probably continue to add to it over the next year, especially if it drops into the $5-$6 range. 

It doesn't have the best short term outlook. The majority of their revenue is still from satellite TV which is a dying business. They've put hella money into acquiring and building a 5G network which is smart because there is no future for the satellite TV business, but it put them in a lot of debt which is a little scary. The play here is whether or not they can make the transition and become a real player in the 5G market. But that is going to take years to find out. This boost mobile thing is a small step to get where they need to be. This news by itself isn't enough, it may have hurt them because they won't profit much from this. $25 is so cheap, and I'm sure Amazon is taking a significant cut of that too. Honestly being too cheap might have been the reason it dropped instead of spiking. Still a long way to go before anyone believes they're a real threat in the wireless space. 

With that being said, I still think they are way undervalued. Their price/book ratio is only .22. I don't really even understand how a stock can even be that cheap, it breaks my brain. I bought more because they just don't have much more room to go down, but if the 5G play works out, I could 5-10x my money in the next 3-5 years. Also, they have really good 5G spectrum assets they could sell to Verizon or AT&T in 2026. Those assets should be hella valuable by then, so it gives the stock some extra downside protection in the long term, or could lead to them being acquired. 

TLDR: To me, DISH is a good long term play because it's super cheap and undervalued. I bought 100 shares on Tuesday, planning on holding for the next 3-5 years. Worst case I lose $750, best case I 10x my money a few years down the road (more realistically 3-5x). Will keep buying more if it gets to the $5-$6 dollar range.",2268,Amazon ,1

27449,15ays6x,How much trouble are Disney in?,2023-07-27,"Disney is in the most danger they have been in for decades.

Cons:

1. They destroyed the Star Wars franchise.
2. They made an Indiana Jones movie no one asked for and then added a terrible character to replace him, but it flopped so bad there will not be another movie for a long time, if at all, and it will be with another character.  This franchise is essentially dead.
3. The upcoming movies are already getting criticized due to the same self-destructive behavior of political correctness (ex. the seven dwarfs are not dwarfs but a motley crew of fully grown people).
4. Universal is opening their park expansion.
5. Writer's strike.
6. They have to spend at least 27 billion later this year to acquire the rest of Hulu.
7. They have zero writing talent at Pixar and Lucas Films and their movies have flopped.
8. Turmoil within Lucas Films management.
9. Lost a billion on the Star Wars hotel.
10. Lost over a billion on films this year.
11. No place to lease movies out being that they have a streaming platform that is losing big money.
12. Need to sell assets to pay for that Hulu deal or find a buyer.
13. Super hero fatigue has led to big movie films losing money.
14. Overpaid for Fox and Marvel.

Pros:

1. They will be bought most likely by Apple if they drop too far.  Market cap is 155 billion which seems a bit high for a company in so much trouble.
2. They have assets to sell, but will most likely sell at a loss due to destroying franchises.
3. Added as Edit: Once Hulu is fully bought Disney can go public with Hulu and most likely will generate a large sum of money in the tens of billions.

The projected quarter was lowered from 1.03 to 0.98 at some point last week.  I don't remember them mentioning this, and expect more of this lowering until results on August 9th.

I don't see where they are making money at all.  My guess is a terrible result way below estimates.  I want to say they lost money and will have a negative quarterly earnings, but it is possible they made some back with their networks and layoffs.  My best guess is 0.38 to 0.56.

Edit: I would like to add that Hulu is a private company and when Disney purchases the remainder, they can and most likely will make it a public company.

65804,15c1csb,August is historically the worst month for the stockmarket.....,2023-07-28,"I agree that first part of August will be strong. We got earnings and a few data points which should be good compared to this time last year. Also, shorts are capitulating and we should get those shorts to be the last of the fomo to sell the bags to. 

I do think second part of August we pull back. Why?

We are hitting 78.6 fib levels. The last 2 months we are only up 2% each month for both indices. Vixx under 15. Rates still high ie 2 year. Basically indicating 0.5% cuts by 2025. 

Now, Rsi weekly is not overbought. But we are showing massive divergence on daily. I.e. hitting new 52 week highs on low weer macd, rsi, money flow, oscillaters etc. 

Here is the key things-
Spy gap fill at 461.xx. 1% away. JPM collar 467. 2.2% Now the collar has been crap but still got to be mindful. 
Qqq gap fill at 396.xx. This is 3.5% away. What's going to get us there. AI. Fomo. Rates. Who knows but I think this gap will be hard to fill but could happen with Apple and the week after. 
Soxx- on a tear. 535.xx gap to fill. 0.2% away. Will be filled for sure. 

I just don't see us going up every month until the end of the year. There has to be a point to drop one month, reset weekly rsi and then push for one final double top. Short term is bullish (next 2 weeks) . After that, bearish for 4 weeks which put us mid September. Could go longer. Then during October anything happens but tilt towards bullish",1404,Apple ,0

Amazon: I'm a seller on the marketplace. They have tightened down on fees and are fucking over sellers left and right. If your goods are lost, stolen or damaged they don't give a fuck anymore.

I think Amazon long term is going to be the next 3T company. This earnings is going to be tight. Cloud projections not great, seller margins very good, Amazon based product margins really bad. I've never seen sales this aggressive this early in the year.

They had invested in a ton of infrastructure during COVID so there costs may be abating but I'm not too knowledgeable there.

I'm going calls at open tomorrow. May switch to stock. PT 140.

Sbux: Seems fairly valued

SoFi: short that garbage, students haven't paid a loan in 3 years. They are just sitting on piles of debt earning nothing.

Airbnb: Long term this will die off. People are sick of their shit ruining neighborhoods. Charging random fees for leaving crumbs behind. Won't play earnings but hope they tank.

Allstate: one of the best insurance companies out there though insurance is struggling with high claims cost. They jacked up premiums and saw some huge gains due to stock investments. Has had a lot of cat loses this year. Will avoid. To many conflicting factors.

What's your net worth, your age , your 401k etc etc

But for 50K, you just don't do this unless you really have some net worth but don't expect it will grow more,  don't make money now, out of job, no hope and tired of your life, want to live differently.

For a 7.5k tax credit, you are thinking to buy a Tesla I think is at the least 50K which tells me you aren't thinking healthy, not to criticize, but why wouldn't you pay the tax instead of Tesla liability! and risk to lose your credit and 'coming to america?'

Going overseas still means you need a lot of money after all you don't want to be starting from bottom there as the locals do
You need money. If you aren't going there with  at least 500K, it might not be an easy life after all

Then again if you have 500K, just pay your taxes. Have a talk with IRS and negotiate a cut and a payment plan. 

I know many people living overseas, they just had enough of the rat race, the dating scene in US, they just enjoy the simple life with less. No worries to careers etc but I don't know anyone doing it because they owe taxes. One guy I know gets a pension from his job in his early 50s , not even retired , one guy owns two properties in US and collects rent living in DR etc etc...

43429,15do2bc,Why are big banks immune to bank run?,2023-07-30,"Because JPM does good banking. SVB run was due to risky investments in treasuries without liquid hedges. When you apply the bond value formula at the time of the run: 

Price(1+%)^number of years=face value

The value was down 40% from the maturity. So the bank didn‚Äôt have money to give the customers their money back. That‚Äôs why the fed bought their bonds at maturity price. 

Big banks don‚Äôt do this. They have enough capital to give money back to the customers when they need so there‚Äôs no run. Only withdrawals. 

For low interest rate accounts, they keep it as a liability and does not lend out. That‚Äôs why they are offering very low interest rate. On the flip side, when the APY is higher, they lend those money out at higher interest rate and give the customers portion of those rates. In return, they need to lock up that money so that the principal doesn‚Äôt get taken out before the lent out money returns to the bank. So you pay penalty if you take those out before agreed locked up dates. Again, big banks manage this well so that it‚Äôs circulating constantly. 

Why not buy treasury instead of checking? First of all, treasury bond is lending money to the government, it‚Äôs not a bank. You can‚Äôt take it out anytime you want or buy something from Amazon with it. You keep it until the maturity unless the premium on yield get higher because the current yield goes down. Then you‚Äôd sell it and pay tax on your interest. So it‚Äôs not 1:1 comparison to only look at the interest rate and going with the higher rate for banking.

Also interest on bonds don‚Äôt compound. They build on the initial amount you lend to them. Without the amount they paid you for taking risk. Bank APY compounds on interest daily. Ie if your $1000 becomes $1000.01, the next day your interest builds on $1000.01 and so forth.",1807,Amazon ,1

The main reason is probably because most people think of bank deposits as real money rather than bank IOUs 

Money market funds are theoretically safer bc they invest in short term treasuries and reverse repo. Neither the US gov or the Fed is going to go bankrupt before a private bank‚Ä¶

Some companies like Apple and others (mostly finance) are offering high interest rates to entice deposits with varying success but still deposits are sticky",585,Apple ,0
43495,15do2bc,Why are big banks immune to bank run?,2023-07-30,"Mainly due to convenience. I have tons of cards all my bills and my direct deposit with chase. It's easier to pay everything then to reset it on another bank. I still use a high yield savings for my e fund but it's nice to have a bank that has branches everywhere that I can withdraw my money. 
Even if just a couple k their spread makes them so much more money. This also means that they can make safer loans for the same returns or they make more if they offer same loans as high yield banks. 

Also most checking accounts aren't that high to have money available like even ally which gave 4% on savings was only giving like .1 on checking. I assume more you spend the higher you need your checking to be to cover purchases without having to wait days for settlement. 

There also more accounts at big banks which means they probably can lower the variance of withdraws as well as good management. So even though I might need 2 k for potential purchase if they have millions of people doing that not all will make purchases. They can probably predict some boundrys of spending put the rest in a treasury and make money off that.",1130,Amazon ,0

>The stock has already gone up quite a bit with the good news lately, as changing like this is very hard, especially with such an old and established company.

but i look at it since the reverse split. It was about $13 dollars and got 1:8 back in 2021... $102 is the number that I seem to remember as a result. So it has only really gained $14 since they made moves to fix shit in 2021.

So it is a good long term play? Based on the above, as long as they are paying dividends... i'd call it a ""safe"" play vs a ""good"" play.

But based on other news, it wont even be the same company in a year or so when they spin-off the pieces that make it a conglomerate. (i admittedly haven't looked much into this tho)

If they stop making new content they get raked over the coals by competitors.

If they trim beloved shows they get shunned by fans.

Imo their only real competition is Apple TV - going for quality content with an infinite bank roll.

Every streaming service but Netflix is in the red. It's already caused HBO to go from a streaming service (HBO Max) to a studio focused on creating content to sell to the highest bidder. They don't want their name and decades of reputation to go down the drain so they stripped the name from it.

 I think we're going to see a return to fewer services as companies find it easier to sell content than compete with a juggernaut provider that is Netflix.

20678,15epiph,Netflix trying to push it's subscribers to an ad-based model is a bad sign,2023-07-31,"Industry person here; the problem with this, is, streaming wasn't supposed to be ad-supported, hence why they didn't have to abide by the old TV rules for paying residuals and disclosing viewer numbers, because old TV has, you guessed it, ads. So if they force users to go ad-supported, then the unions have every right to get the residuals they used to get under old TV rules and bylaws. 

That also forces them to disclose viewership numbers for said residual deals. 


This won't end well for the studios who run streaming services as they still haven't turned a profit from streaming. Not even Netflix; they're close, but after all this time, still haven't. 

This is where their executive greed has finally met its match. These old boomers aren't in-tune with the times and their antiquated way of running the business isn't feasible for technology and a weaker dollar.

Floating Trains and LK-99

Next week, some American, European, and Brazilian business folx are going to sell all their stock in marijuana companies. This thing can make trains float, like out of a movie. Anyone not regarded are skeptical of the strategy, but it turns out there was some behind the scenes drama about how causing massive pot bankruptcies is going to drive the price for an eighth way down. Evidently, 3 of them published the findings early so they could be first and, more importantly, be eligible for a Nobel prize. So the working theory is that they think they‚Äôve discovered this thing, and now these ""scientists"" are risking the entire free pot industry and (even worse) shame that this thing works. They need to score fast, so the sell-off is going to be sloppy, but worth it given their confidence and the implications of the research. 

The thing is, it takes time. And red phosphorus, which is used to make meth, is available now. Nonetheless, we‚Äôre expecting to hear something by Tuesday of next week. 

If the legal pot market crashes like they say, that changes everything. Trains will float in the air, teslas will have coast to coast range, and the recession will be canceled. A new Industrial Revolution will emerge. 

For me this goes a little taller. I don't think the fall harvest is ready for a market correction of this magnitude.

Like any degenerate, my next move was to find a company with the name ‚Äúsuperconductor‚Äù in it and buy calls. I found a small cap so I can‚Äôt post it here, but I have a price target of $25 on a $9 stock. I‚Äôll be selling the news next week. I hope you‚Äôve enjoyed the humor",1651,Tesla ,0

(Modelo for example is gaining market share)

My workings:

[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anheuser-busch-bud-light-layoffs-dylan-mulvaney-kid-rock-ryan-young/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anheuser-busch-bud-light-layoffs-dylan-mulvaney-kid-rock-ryan-young/)

\> AB InBev sold $71.5 million worth of Bud Light during the week ending July 16 (in the US)

This was down 26.5% so lets say they're usually doing 100m (seasonal so fuck knows if this is right, but let's assume it's an upper bound given it seems like prime beer-drinking time), annually that works out at something like 5b

$BUDs annual revenues for 2022 we're around 50-60b, therefore this represents c.10%, which has dropped 26.5% which represents a c.2.5% drop in revenue.

edit: corrected on Modelo not being owned by $BUD in the US, however the BL fiasco still looks like it's going to be a maximum 2-3% hit to revenue: so I can only conclude this bearish dd is overblown

Even with the rate hikes, we are nearing ATH and it's making me nervous. 

The interest rate means 2 things to me (and I suspect for many others) : leveraging is too expensive and sitting cash is collecting 5% w/o any risks. Both these factors must mean less cash going to stocks all factors being equal.

I see it as a losing proposition right now, i.e., downside overweighting upside.

I might short SPY if we go above 4600 and if the interest to borrow shares is low.

70196,15gj1f1,Why should everyone be bullish right now?,2023-08-02,"As far as earnings. There were a few surprises but nothing great. Stocks basically beat and didn't go down. The lynch pin will be nvda. When this bull run started in May, earnings played out pretty much the way they are now. Nvda reports blew up the ai bubble. Market becomes obsessed with ai. Ai carries the market forward and brings money sitting on sidelines back to market. Nvda reports 8/23. 3 weeks. Lots of bouncing around til then. Amzn appl will probably be theta sellers' dreams like tsla. In fact up until nvda reported last quarter, the year was setting up for a theta year where s&p was going to be up 5%, and we would be happy. Basically, it's going to be a year to accumulate. 

As far as nvda earnings, msft basically stated ai is the future, and they are all in. Billions of dollars will be spent on ai. Now, where do they spend the money. If nvda executes the way they stated they would in the last quarter conference call, then s&p hits 5000. If nvda disappoints, then I am going to start looking at may resistance levels.

As far as tailwinds, we have oil. Production cuts, hurricane season coming in, strategic reserves at lowest point in 40 years. We could see a resurgence of inflation due to oil. Give the market a 2 month lag if oil hits 100 a barrel in the fall.",1288,Tesla Nvidia Amazon Microsoft ,0

India is a barely tapped market. Much of their attention going to the 2nd most populated country on the planet. 

The last quarter service revenue was up double digits as well as a % of total portfolio. If that trend continues, they make more profit margin on service revenues than manufacturing. Meaning manufacturing can stagnate or decrease slightly and their profitability will continue to grow on equal or less sales. Apple serves as a platform for AI advancement. Check your voicemail by listening to it? Or by AI Text generation? Their product mix is cyclical, with customers upgrading every 3-4 years on average.

When I retired in 2014, I stopped working and stopped investing aggressively.  My current net worth, even in this crappy market, is approximately $1.7 million or a 10% return since 2014.  (At one point in 2021 it was $2.2 million but I made some foolish decisions and taxes bit me hard.)

Rookie investing mistakes (which I occasionally still do):

\- Not selling stock when it's obvious you need to either because it really is circling the drain or you have a pressing expense.  (It's amazing how sentimental I get!)  It's a financial investment, not a kitten.  

\- Getting emotionally overhyped when the market hiccups up one day or a season.  This leads to not investing regularly, buying high or worse, selling high and spending the money on BS.  Be blas√©. 

\- Getting super emotionally bummed when the market hiccups down one day (like today) or a season.  This leads to not investing regularly (I'd be \~$100k richer if I hadn't done this in 2008), not buying low, selling low or worse, selling low and spending the money on BS.  Be blas√©. 

\- Treating the market like a casino.  You can treat the market like a casino if you want.  And it will treat you like any casino treats a gambler.  It will take more money than it coughs up.  If you're a gambling addict it will straight up fleece you.

Fitch is the US' bitch. 

US debt is always in dollars and thus the US can pay it even if it's infinity^infinity^infinity^infinity times infinity^infinity^infinity^infinity. The US can't ever NOT pay USD based debt because they somehow don't have enough USD. There is no limit of USD we can print. The backlash is merely inflation. The only risk is that Washington clowns like playing chicken game too far with the debt ceiling^(that other countries don't even have btw) that comes around every few years but that's mostly peacocking. Even IF the line was crossed it would be US government employees who don't get paid first.

There's no better alternative to the USD. Russian ruble? Chinese yuan? Japanese yen? Euros^(*actually not that bad but not better than USD*)?!??! Unless you're ok with hulking around tons of gold and paying 5-10% transaction fees whenever you want to convert them into dollars.",1188,Apple Amazon ,0

* üåàüêªs: WSB regards. Scrubs that who watched the big short and think they can be the next Burry. Fools who get fooled into thinking shorting works. Edgy contrarians.

Talks shit. Tries to monger fear. Doesn't do DD. Thinks they are smart realizing basic ass shit like ""X retailer is getting disrupted by Amazon"" as if it isn't priced it.

Often loses more than they win assuming they don't lose it all.

* Permabears: Stephen Weiss or those guys from Risk reversal.

Always bearish. Always feeling bearish. Always talking bearish. Always calling the next recession. Always thinking about the next recession. The pessimists and contrarians are here.

Their portfolios are often still long but more defensive but they talk this way because their clients are probably rich old boomers who want someone more risk adverse or use them as a hedge (only gotta get rich once if you don't fuck it up).

* Doomerbear type A: ""uSD iS kILl!!!"" gold shillers like Robert Kiyosaki, X gonna collapse YT guys like Graham Stephan, ""Everything is going to hell"" types, etcetcetc

Always calling the end of times. Every week is the judgement day, nuclear  Armageddon, zombie pandemic outbreak, US collapse, alien invasion, etcetc until the next week.

Often narcissistic liars since they are often still fully invested. If Kiyosaki really felt the US was going to hell he wouldn't have a 401k in the US stock market or all that US real estate. Yet he's telling you to buy gold and canned tuna (as if he's selling you that shit? hmmmmmmm......).  But they mostly speak to old boomers and regards who want to be fed that bullshit so there's no problem. Old, grumpy, bitter, and shriveling ass boomers would want to feel the rest of the world is also bitter and going to hell so it make them feel less lonely. These charlatans take advantage of this and shills them fake/real gold, coins, or tuna.

Other types like Graham Stephan just makes the most punchable stupid face possible, has fire in the background, and claims something will collapse to get YT clicks. 

* Doomerbear type B: Those who aren't shilling things.

Just likes calling the end. Just likes doing it. Not shilling anything. Just calls it all the type for their own reasons be it religion, being edgy contrarians, or just really bearish. 

Can't miss calling the recession if you call it every year, every month, every day, every minute, and every second.

* Real bears

Carnivoran mammals. Pretty adaptive. Omnivorous. Will eat anything. 

Not too optimistic. Not too pessimistic. Very Ursidae but not bearish. Not Bovinae but not bullish. [Only opinion on the markets is ""Can't a brotha go shopping without you fucking hairless apes harassing me?""?](https://youtu.be/zWxXzaE8srA)

* Those other ""Real bears"" aka Michael Burry or the Bears that actually make money

Walks the talk instead of just talking the talk. Actually goes short instead of just talking about it or talking about the globalwarming-nucleariceage-superpandemic-hyperinflation-hyperdeflation-zombieapolocylse-worldwar4-planetoftheapesrevolution-multiverseevilUSAinvasion-alieninvasion-GFC3.0uberrecession-completesocietalcollapse

The GOOD real bears are actually NOT always bearish. They realize they are ""bearish"" but only to the point that they are playing a literal fucking numbers game with certain rules that only applies if the US/Global financial system doesn't completely collapse. Is often long because they know the market usually goes up most of the time. Shorts individual stocks opportunistically when they see overbought/valued situation they can exploit (kind of like those other real bears?). Will go in big with shorts but only during downturns or corrections. Sometimes not even going full short so much as cashing out to cash as a hedge.

so now you got a few hundred to a few thousand shares of whatever, and 85k in debt.

By tomorrow open, those shares you own, are either worth more than what you got assigned for, and you sell them, and you made a profit that likely would be quite a bit more than you thought possible, or they are going to be worth less than what you got assigned for, and you are gonna have lost a lot more than you thought possible.

Essentially, a coin flip. Good luck to you, and before you do anything really fucking stupid, like the AMD guy, please make a post here asking if it is a good idea (even better to ask somewhere else truth be told). Never take on risk after an unexpected loss. NEVER.

In a televised interview with CBS News, Biden told the correspondent Tracy Smith that he found himself ""on my hands and knees picking through rugs"" and mistook granular substances like Parmesan cheese for cocaine on more than one occasion.  
  
""I probably smoked more Parmesan cheese than anyone that you know,"" Biden said, adding that he once went 13 days without sleeping, ""smoking crack and drinking vodka exclusively throughout that entire time.""  
  
Biden was talking to CBS about a passage in his new book, ""Beautiful Things,"" in which he described locking himself in his apartment in Washington, DC, bingeing on crack cocaine with a homeless woman who had moved in with him and taught him how to get high. At one point, he described combing through the carpet for little remnants of cocaine to smoke that may or may not have actually been cheese.

""It didn't matter,"" he wrote. ""I smoked it.""  
  
Donald Trump Jr. quickly took to social media to troll Biden, posting an image of a lighter, a pipe, and a jar of Parmesan cheese on his Instagram story.

Henrik seems to be crazy, also he has a past beef with Elon Musk. 

Fisker needs to come out with something pumpy about chargers on the Tesla Network which is going to be difficult considering the above point I just made.

Henrik having his wife be Dr. chief financial officer as well as Chief operating officer isn't a great look. Check her linked in, she's more talented than him in many regards and appears to be job hunting with her bio.

They own a substantial amount of the company they have a lot riding on this. 

all of the cars look pretty fucking great, and the Austrian ones are very very well built they're working through all the normal production kinks that EV startups work through and they seem to be tackling things like champs. 

They have to get production up and keep margins under control, but if the Foxconn deal actually goes thru with the production numbers they talked about ... it's absolutely bonkers that they're going to be producing 250,000 cars annual at a average sale price of 40k+ and only be valued at 2 billion dollars.

56763,15j4xjk,Why is the stock market still stable despite raising interest rates?,2023-08-05,"Mostly because of the inflation rate. Assets are worth more with inflation and debt will be less.

If I have debt of 10.000.000. it stays 10.000.000 but because money is now worth less my debt is less too. 

Same goes for the building the company has its office in and all other assets from trucks, cars to machinery. Since stocks have a direct correlation with the underlying value of the company they can stabilise or rise with inflation.

Sincerely, then i adjusted my strategy to watch for a major drop and buy back in  when the  metrics felt satisfactory. I have killed it on LMT, Meta, Apple, amd, pbf, four, and others during the past 10 days. The problem right now is that the institutions are searching for perfection. The earning could be a beat but if one area in the balance sheet is lagging, then the banks and hedge funds do a sell off. It is a ridiculous mentality. Even Warren Buffet said this publicly recently. Take aapl for example . It beat on estimated eps and overall earnings but because the US sales were lagging for the 3rd qtr in a row the stock plunged.

64297,15jh46r,Sell AAPL,2023-08-06,"I think it's simply a natural evolution. I used to renew my phones every 2 years. I replaced my Iphone X with a Iphone 12 Pro specifically because I wanted to have eSim capability. Had it ever since and didn't find the need to buy a 13 or 14. And unless the 15 offers something new probably same story.

&#x200B;

The amount of innovation in phones is slowing, this is true for all the brands. So the pace at which people renew their phones will also slow.

&#x200B;

In addition to that I think the high prices for the flagship models are pricing them out of the market in emerging markets. I live in Asia. During the ages of Iphone 6-7-8 everybody and their dog needed to have the newest model as a status symbol. When the 6S came out, you had the pink color that was 6S specific and you had guys carrying a pink phone just to show off that it was a 6S and not a 6. IMHO Iphone X broke that trend with it's outrageous (for the time) $1000 price tag. The latest flagship models are around $1800 I believe. People are just not willing to pay that sort of money for a product that barely offers anything over the outgoing model.

&#x200B;

I think it also has to do with design. Iphone 12-13-14 are essentially looking the same, they could do with a updated design. For me that is a weighing factor as well, I don't like to spend money on something that looks the same and does the same. For most people it's just a expensive social media browser anyway.

&#x200B;

Mac is a difficult product. It's way too expensive compared to a windows based system. You essentially need to look at it as buying a piece of stylish furniture instead of a functional product. I have considdered buying a macbook in the past but all the ones I tried in the store were slow and unresponsive except for the gigaexpensive top model so I was quickly put off that.

Profits on parks saw an all time high.  Attendance did hit its peak but the increase in prices and cutting cost has made this a. Ash machine.  Additionally parks in china are co timing to grow with a large recovery lag from Covid shutdowns.  Overall don‚Äôt see an issue here.

Until Barbie, no one saw success at the box office.  With that said, saying the Disney doesn‚Äôt have any content left dispute the rights to marvel, Star Wars and dozens of content opportunities is narrow sided.  Maybe stumbled but there is plenty of gun powder here.  Additionally box office support is nice for some premium but focusing on streaming adds value for releases. (Agree Indiana Jones is a flop)

Disney+ is posed to produce profit in 2024 and the subscriber list is majority due to the rights issue in India, most likely a good decision to walk away from this consider many of them will open a vpn if interested (similar happened to Netflix).

As much as I appreciate that you are a critic and enjoy other content more, I don‚Äôt see you as representing what most consumers will view as Disney+ for their families considering the price.

They will buy the rest of Hulu and either deploy a solution to become a legitimate player or sell that business (both positive for the company).  ESPN finally getting into sports wagering, very positive for the company.  China now open very positive for the company.  Igor is managing costs, finally, but key will be strategy shifts and next stage of growth for the company.

Also from a technical standpoint, we have a double bottom and stuck within a narrow and critical trading level.  Any news on cost cutting or revenue growth drives the stock to rip higher to 100-102",1813,Apple ,1

18556,15lnoos,How do i buy puts on canada?,2023-08-08,"I think part of the problem is the lack of profitable investment opportunities in Canada. 

When the 2008 financial crash hit, Canada went into austerity mode under the Harper government, who sought and managed to ""balance the budget"". The problem with balancing the budget is that it means pulling money out of your economy. If this is done during a time of boom, it's not a problem and is probably pretty healthy for your economy. It is a terrible thing to do while recovering from a financial crash though. It pulls money out of a struggling economy... money that would have gone to rebuilding industries in new and in-demand fields. Instead, Canada received very little public investment to restructure the economy while it was in a position to do so. Now, 15 years later, we are lagging behind our peers who did stimulate their economies at that time (I see Australia as the prime example).

That being said, Canada is still a very stable country with vast natural resources, which means that it is a safe place to store your wealth. Given the lack of business development to invest in, the next best investment is real estate, hence you have both foreign and local investors clamoring to buy up all of the available housing stock. Canada just didn't bother building up the industrial capacity to woo that money back out of the real estate market, so it has continued to accumulate there.

The same pattern can be seen in the price of gold. Every time there is a collapse of the financial system, in the 1930's, 1970's and early 2000's, there is a spike in the price of gold as investors seek a safe haven for their money while the economy finds a new avenue for development. The difference is that gold doesn't pay you rent, whereas real estate does. Therefore the ROI for industrial investment must be significantly higher than the ROI on rent in order to shift that investment capital out of the housing market.",1919,Amazon ,0

Most days I was grabbing 2 double cheeseburgers for $2.15, because I always had a dime and nickel in my car it seemed.  And this was before the lighter mcdouble even.   And it was the perfect amount to hold me over.  The park was like 3 blocks from my mcdonalds so I'd stop and enjoy the day for a few minutes.

But nearly *every day* during the week.    It added up, on top of other late night snacking and general unhealthiness.    I enlisted in the army in '03 at 225 and they told me not to gain another pound, graduated 185.  By 2015 the scale started to touch 300.

Hell by that time 2 mcdoubles was now pushing towards $4, so they stopped.  snacking kinda curved, instead of candy it turned into packaged crackers and mini slim jims.     Didn't really start a routine, but just eating better, now in 2023 I'm sitting 230 and if I could actually get off my lazy ass I could get back to high school weight.

19004,15nnokk,Give me a reason NVDA isn't the most regard stock on the market right now,2023-08-10,"My take on NVDA is similar to Jays2Cents recent video.

IMO, the 4000 serie is a disaster. 4090's plug melting aside, It still sell OK because lots of people could not get the 3000 serie.

But TSMC is very limited in term of production capacity, there is still a chip sortage because (in part, IMO) car manufacturers apparently want 5mn in their car instead of having their own 50mn chip factory.

You don't need TSMC top capabilities for cars. Plenty of room and power.

I disgress. Point is everyone wants a production slot with TSMC. So TSMC quotas are limited.

NVDA will prefer focussing on AI, which, per chip, is way more lucrative. (Like 10x more money), and they can't meet the demand for those already.

At least short term, NVDA can print as mich money has TSMC will allow them to. The question is: should they print $1000 bills (AI) or $10 bills (GPU) ?


But here's the answer you are looking for:
 if you forgo the gamers again, AMD will sure seize the opportunity. And as more people are forced to try AMD cards and like them, the gaming market could shift.

So short term, NVDA will please investor with AI.
But if there is a shortage of the 5000 serie, there is the possibility of a bad story on the long term.

For example if people can't get the 5000 serie because of a shortage while Nvidia focus on AI, people switch to AMD and are happy (better value for your money, good performance, nothing melting, etc), AND AI get regulated and the fade dies down like crypto did...

THEN NVidia might be in a bad situation.

Their PE looks absurd, but they currently have 95%+ of their market. It's basically a monopoly, but no one else is even close to the research and development NVDA has. They will continue to sell video cards to gamers at higher and higher prices and in more and more quantity. There are 2 generations currently of adults who don't even game. Every time an old person dies, 3 young kids who want a computer just convinced their mom to buy them one.

And this will carry on further, just these factors alone of more people and better cards will 3x their revenue in 10 years. Add in their AI capability that no one can touch, and you'll probably 3x this number as well, likely more like 5.

So now we have a potential 15x scenario, maybe even more, putting their PE more in line with 10-15 (simply speaking). And I don't think this is absurdly optimistic. If AI changes the world like many think it will, then this number is extremely conservative.

""unemployment is low, but that means rate is up. dump SPY.""

The way you can actually make big money off of this is by getting a few friends to start a rumour that your company is doing so well (or so badly)... while not giving off enough information to implicate you. Then when it gives you enough profit, you let go.

The SEC, while they don't leverage it unless they get high probability outliers, can correlate trades on tickers by one family member another family works for. The smart insiders just tell a friend and have the friend trade and give them a cut. They also mix it in with similar sized trades of other tickers (this is why it's good to have insider info on more than one ticker).

There was a case not long ago where someone who worked at a fortune 500 (maybe it was aapl, can't remember) who was giving their family member insider info related to earnings and he would trade bullish on positive earnings and bearish on negative earnings with a 100% prediction rate matching the report over like 10 quarters. It was the only thing they traded and made insane profits which is probably what flagged it as an outlier. 

I think the biggest thing was one of them cracked when they got interrogated and shown the evidence.

11958,15p6iqe,Is this insider trading?,2023-08-12,"I‚Äôll give a serious answer here.

The majority of Americans work for a publicly traded company and are likely to run across things that the general public doesn‚Äôt know.  Everyday workers know about backorders, potential recalls, and/or layoffs before they occur.  You can try to trade based on that information, but ultimately it‚Äôs a fools errand because the only real data that affects stocks is known by the executives at the top and that data is not shared liberally.  Companies are compartmentalized making it hard to see the larger picture even if you‚Äôre a VP of a division.

Let‚Äôs use Amazon as an example.  A VP of their media division may know it‚Äôs heavily in the red that quarter, perhaps subscribers are significantly lower than expected.  But he won‚Äôt have knowledge of the 50 other divisions.

I own a trucking company and I don't know shit about your industry. You don't know shit about mine. You are just wrong on so many levels that I really don't know where to start.

First, big tech companies like Uber and Amazon came to commercial transportation and the failed miserably to replace us, despite pumping billions. Read how uber got kicked down to the curb , lost billions and was forced to by Transplace - a proper freight brokerage for $3 billion in order to finally turn profit.

2nd - you can't code away fresh chicken, oversized load, tarping and chaining, driver tailgate... you don't even know what I'm talking about, right? Exactly - there are millions of shippers with different infrastructure, docks, rules, procedures... it just doesn't work like that, even if you make the truck autonomous- you still need a person inside of it.

Even if they release autonomos, driverless trucks TOMORROW and even if somehow they don't get regulated by DOT (notoriously slow to implement anything) - me and other carriers just won't buy them - we HATE new technology - it has problems that need to be ironed out, the trucks spend more time in the shop than the road, very few mechanics know how to work on them... and please don't tell me they will ""update the code online"" - which brings me to the next point.

IT'S NOT A FUCKING CAR! It's a commercial vehicle! It has to work for 150k-300k miles PER YEAR in order to be profitable! It has to work in different altitudes, weather, temperatures, road conditions. And it has to do it MORE PROFITABLY than the driver-operated one. 

Let's say I get one of those driverless vehicles TOMORROW and let it operate immediately - who's gonna put fuel in it? Who's gonna check the tire pressure and the tire wear? How much do I have to pay to for a towing company if it glitches? Is my insurance gonna cover an accident? What if the insurance charges me more for AI vehicle? Who's gonna put straps and loadlocks? Who's gonna walk to the check in desk to pick up the paperwork?

These questions are just from the top of my head. All of these situations and thousands more happen daily in this industry and currently a driverless truck will end up costing me more than one with a driver.

So I repeat again, stay in your lane, play with your meme stocks, cryptos or whatever you kids do these days and leave my industry to the professionals. You sound like fucking children when you tell me - the professional - how things are happening in my industry..",2523,Amazon ,0

The market isn't exactly ""collapsing."" This perception might arise from the fact that your share of the economic pie, already small, is gradually being absorbed by larger corporate entities engaged in a fierce struggle to assert dominance and monopolize resources.

Speaking from my experience in the entertainment industry, I can certainly empathize with the challenges faced by the WGA and SAG strikers. However, it's undeniable that their position is increasingly precarious. The advancements in technology have bestowed studios with an unprecedented level of control, leading to a significant devaluation of human talent and creativity. The astonishing speed at which AI can craft a play set in the 1960s, drawing from a Stephen King narrative in the style of Hemingway, merely in a matter of seconds, exemplifies this reality. Furthermore, the quality of content on platforms like Netflix often leaves much to be desired, prompting some writers to reconsider their career choices. The sight of individuals dressed as Pikachu and Princess Mononoke picketing outside Paramount Studios, reminiscent of a comic convention, adds a tinge of sadness to the scene. In all likelihood, figures like Bob Iger might even find amusement in these events.

The imminent reality of self-driving vehicles replacing truck drivers and AI taking over customer service roles is undeniable. Amazon's utilization of AI-powered chatbots for customer interactions is a glaring example. Soon, AI will emulate human speech patterns so effectively that even call center agents from India will find their roles in jeopardy.

Fast-forwarding a mere decade, if not sooner, the very act of creating diverse forms of media will become an almost instantaneous process. Whether it's a film, TV show, book, painting, or virtual reality experience, the click of a button will suffice. You could seamlessly position yourself as the protagonist in an entirely AI-generated Fast and Furious installment or even star in a brand-new Transformers feature, your own visage enhancing the narrative. The transformative influence of AI on media consumption isn't lost on studios; hence, their steadfast stance.

Broadening our perspective, numerous colossal corporations exhibit a similar unwavering stance. They've garnered a stranglehold over the common populace, reflecting a rather unsavory reality. This predicament shares a semblance with the construction of the Great Wall of China, where fatigued or ailing laborers were literally blended into the cement mix that eventually solidified into the wall itself.

This analogy aptly characterizes the state of affairs. While the market isn't crumbling per se, it's plausible that those positioned at the lower echelons might perceive it as such, given the metaphorical 'cementing' they endure in constructing the edifice of global capitalism.",2992,Amazon Meta ,0

That said, put options may provide a similar solution if you'd prefer to stay invested. If I had 100 shares or 1000, I think I would have been buying puts a while ago. Something could (should) be said about companies splitting the stock so their smaller 'investors' have access to hedging products and could potentially remain invested, instead of having to make buy/sell their only option.

Why bother, there was no shortage of human labor, and reorienting their production would only cause unrest. The empire lasted hundreds of years, but picking grapes was done by hand from start to finish. 

Slavery in the southern US became economically non viable when foreign competition from cheap labor could produce the same cotton for less. It had already failed in the British empire for similar reasons. Then, the cotton gin came along, which increased worker output enough to make the plantation model barely viable again. Barely. Another 50 years, then the Civil War, and then industrialization killed off the plantation entirely. Today one dude on a machine in one day picks as much cotton as 200 did in a week.

If they reduce labor to where 50/70/90% of the population is unemployed or underemployed they will have no one to purchase their goods and in effect be shooting themselves in the foot.

What happens to Amazon when they‚Äôve automated everything but now no one can afford to purchase anything from Amazon except for the senior director and above levels that monitor the daily automation? The value of the company tanks‚Ä¶

Tesla automates logistic shipping, taxis, etc. millions of jobs gone‚Ä¶

What happens to blackrock and all of these investors purchasing real estate when all of a sudden no one can afford the outrageous rents anymore? Will we finally see livable rents? Housing prices are slashed to 10, 20, 50k dollars because that‚Äôs all anyone can afford on next to zero income? Those funds become insolvent or get a bailout from the government because they‚Äôre ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù?

Does the government introduce UBI? Well that‚Äôs not very ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù and sounds pretty socialist/communist to 50% of the country right?!

The politicians need to step in FAST to control the automation of the labor force before it all spirals. Pass legislation that states AI can be used ‚Äúin addition to‚Äù and not ‚Äúto be replaced‚Äù or the whole system crumbles and we are Rome 2033.

(deets in text below),2023-08-15,"This is not just dot com bubble, an arguably bigger trap happened after the 1929 crash and there were several small traps throughout the 73-74 bear market.

The market is continually trying to figure out whether the selling is overdone relative to future earnings. Where I would disagree with you is that I think this rally is largely due to down trending inflation data and a suspected soft landing (if only brief) coupled with extremely depressed prices at the end of 22 allowing a springboard effect which carried on for several months and less about AI.

Personally I believe this rally will look like a bear market rally for a lot of stocks in retrospect (remember that some stocks like Apple and Nvidia hit new ath‚Äôs during this rally) now that the fed is done hiking BUT is likely leaving rates at elevated levels until something bad happens which is going to continue to drain liquidity gradually from the markets.

Ultimately whether this is just a temporary correction or a lasting bear market depends on whether a recession actually comes. During bear markets bad news is interpreted as bad news and it continues to pile up. Then you get a respite where suddenly people think stocks are a bargain and there‚Äôs a headlong rush back into risk assets that‚Äôs short-lived and the next day or next week another bad headline comes out.

I think this selloff is for real though and the stocks that are most expensive and not growing or stable will get cut by 80+%.

Tech stocks dip every Aug & Fall.. some bigger than others. You're assuming that this crash is going to be the next 2001 without 9/11 among other events.

Long term it comes down to adoption curves. Knowing that AI is already the fastest adoption curve in human history, are you really willing to risk missing out on the next major tech trend (that surpasses the growth between 1994 and 2008)?

I focus on investing in fastest growing adoption curves both on the enterprise and consumer side. I buy SaaS companies that consistently beat the rule of 40. 

I own puts as hedge. Every time one of my major tech holdings drops 10% I buy more leap calls close to the money. Every time it drops 20% or more I buy more calls. I take profits on calls and buy puts. I rarely sell shares. My account is doing well. I don't worry about the market crash because I have puts at all times.",1132,Apple Google Microsoft ,0

19193,15s5ysw,Eat Shit Netflix You Over Priced Unoriginal Fuck Heads,2023-08-15,"There's no need to cook the books when you can just raise the price.  This isn't unique to Netflix.  Most services are doing so.  They know what revenue they want to hit, and it's easy to just turn that dial.  The best part is almost no one leaves on a price increase.  Netflix raises prices several times a year, every year, since they started.  And every time, the subscriber count trends unchanged.  Even the massive negative PR smear and stock crash over a ""bad"" Q1, the actual subscribers and revenue was on trend.  Even the bad Q1 was still above trend.

Why is Netflix stock going up, because it never actually faultured.  All we got was a really cheap buy-in to make an easy 2x in a year on whatever we threw at it and 4x if you feel like riding it all the way back.  Frankly, I expected it to bounce back twice as fast.

Why is the price so high?  I don't know.  It just is.  It's also high because it's the biggest player in the game.  The only thing comparable is Prime, and that's a multi-faceted service.  Everything else is a fraction.  Everything else doesn't grow at nearly the same rate.  Only Disney grows faster, because, well, it's Disney.  But even then flattened and are dropping.  Netflix isn't.  Hulu, HBO, and Paramount are flattening.  Netflix isn't.

One important note with Netflix is there are two VERY different markets at play.  One is the US market.  The other is the rest of the world.  The world market for Netflix is HOT and is a gravy train for them.  Yeah, US subscribers have faultured.  The world subscribers have not.  Part of why it's bigger than most realize is because it's absolutely dominating the world streaming space.  Again, they are as big as Prime.  Prime!  Netflix is that big, has the same amount, has the same growth as Prime.  They're that big, even if everyone wants to think they're not.",1844,Amazon ,1

28011,15rfj2u,"Streaming TV costs now higher than cable, as 'crash' finally hits",2023-08-15,"According to my most recent analysis, the average American subscribes to 2.8 services, which each cost approximately $141/each per year, meaning the average person spends about $395/year on top of their internet/TV/phone plan however that's bundled - including a lot of providers who bundle 1, 2, or more streamers with whatever plan you get.

If you look on the typical On-Demand menu, they may boast having some 35,000+ titles. However if you looked deep enough into them, like Michael Burry did with mortgages, you'd see that a vast majority of those projects are no-budget indie films without so much as a thumbnail image. Cheap distributors can convince indie filmmakers to pay them money to be distributed here.

$DIS has (61) classic films, forgetting about Star Wars or Marvel they acquired later. HBO has maybe (250) total films or TV shows you'd ever actually want to intentionally watch, especially with re-watch value. The studios carrying the most titles are $WBD & $PARA who each have 1,000 - 2,500 in their offering.

All tolled, there are maybe a MAXIMIM of 5,000 actually watchable titles worth having on any service. Nobody can watch that much all at once, and nobody needs to have access to all of it at once. Have you noticed how poorly the navigations are set up on these apps with thousands of titles? EVEN AMAZON sucks at organizing digital movies but they have the ""everything store?!""

My point here is the crash hasn't happened in streaming yet but it's not for lack of wanting. You could split those 5,000 titles I mentioned into (12) months or (4) quarters and have 500-1,250 titles available from across the board at each interval with typical programming of when titles are available or not. That should cost a fraction of the current set up because of how many fewer titles that service would be licensing per year or length of contract.

If people could get the overall cost of ""streaming"" down by packaging better, it would become potentially profitable. A few more things need to be done but that is a fundamental that needs changing. If anybody know Bob Iger or Zaslav tell them to hit me up. My fees are reasonable.",2151,Amazon ,1

You'd get approximately 69% profit if it goes there after earnings and you just close it then and there.

Holding just the put means you need NVDA to drop below $385 for you to make more gains than your cap would be with the short put. It's possible but not as likely as people being delusional and holding at a price that just theta fucks you despite being right. Also it cuts your loss in half if you're early, aka wrong.

All the farmers in India started dusting their crops with Coke. ü§£ Then they demanded Coke to hand over their recipe. üòÇ That was actually their end goal so they could start producing Coke themselves.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock is considered great by many investors because of its strong financial performance, dominant market position, and growth prospects in the artificial intelligence (AI) and data center markets.

Here are some of the reasons why NVDA stock is considered great:

* **Strong financial performance:** Nvidia has consistently reported strong financial results in recent years. In its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $8.2 billion, up 46% year-over-year. Earnings per share were $2.56, up 61% year-over-year. Nvidia's revenue and earnings are expected to continue growing at a rapid pace in the coming years.
* **Dominant market position:** Nvidia is the leading provider of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used in a wide range of applications, including gaming, artificial intelligence, and data centers. The company has a strong competitive advantage in the GPU market, and its products are used by a wide range of customers, including major technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.
* **Growth prospects in AI and data center markets:** The AI and data center markets are two of the fastest-growing markets in the world, and Nvidia is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. The company's GPUs are used in a wide range of AI applications, such as self-driving cars, facial recognition, and natural language processing. Nvidia is also a leading provider of chips for data centers, which are used to store and process large amounts of data.

Of course, no stock is without its risks. Some of the risks associated with NVDA stock include:

* **High valuation:** NVDA stock is currently trading at a high valuation. This means that the stock is expensive, and there is a risk that the price could fall if the company's financial performance does not meet expectations.
* **Competition:** Nvidia faces competition from other chipmakers, such as AMD and Intel. These companies are also developing new products that could compete with Nvidia's GPUs.
* **Technological changes:** The technology industry is constantly changing, and there is a risk that Nvidia could be disrupted by new technologies.

Overall, NVDA stock is considered a great investment by many investors. However, it is important to carefully consider the risks before investing in the stock.

In terms of whether NVDA is a good stock to buy now, the answer depends on your investment goals and risk tolerance. If you are looking for a stock that has the potential to grow significantly in the long term, then NVDA could be a good option. However, it is important to remember that the stock is currently trading at a high valuation, and there is a risk that the price could fall if the company's financial performance does not meet expectations.",2777,Apple Nvidia Amazon Microsoft ,0

68328,15suulh,Amazon Is Imposing Fee on Sellers Who Ship Products Themselves,2023-08-16,"I used to sell quite a lot through Amazon. Few years ago drop shipping etc worked really well. Then the fees went up - so used both FBA shipping on my own shipping. Then they upped the fees on both. 

I've given up now as I simply can't compete with a few big sellers that sell for under my China purchase price. Was nice briefly, not only that if you are a seller they really don't care about you. Customer returns something because they have damaged it, instant refund. Customer says they haven't received it, even when tracking says received, instant refund.",561,Amazon ,1
68329,15suulh,Amazon Is Imposing Fee on Sellers Who Ship Products Themselves,2023-08-16,"Interesting.

Theres a lot of price errors on amazon where something may be listed as 9,99 instead of 99,99. In those cases it depends on who ships it.

If amazon ships it then the seller is screwed. They don‚Äôt care that there was an error in the listing and will ship at whatever the sale price is. This is how I got my first 3d printer for 20 instead of 220. 

If the seller ships themselves, it‚Äôs almost guaranteed that they will cancel the order and cite that the item is out of stock. I can understand this as a small company can‚Äôt afford to make such a huge mistake and end up footing bill in the thousands or tens of thousands. 

If they start forcing sellers to use amazon then any mistake of their part could literally put them out of business. That intern forgetting a decimal point means you‚Äôre now bankrupt.",819,Amazon ,1

Most of it was chinese crap with pop-up company names, but still. So I can kind of understand this to a degree, also limits Amazon's liability (yes, they would try to get the refund money from the seller, but that didn't always work out).

However, Amazon is a shitty place to work, so fuck 'em. Makes me wonder about their most recent earnings report and AWS losing some steam.",532,Amazon ,1

This is the first time I‚Äôm seriously considering buying it. I don‚Äôt see any scenario where it disappears, but my question is how much can it grow, & would it be better to just buy more $V (which I already own). Some of $PYPL‚Äôs positives: 
- owns Vemno, a fast-growing part of the business. 
- is growing total transactions. 
- handles the vast majority of eBay transactions, which is a captive audience that won‚Äôt go away. 
- has a successful pay-in-4 option. 
- Ideal for small-biz; dispute resolution is easy & the platform integrates well with other software. 
- has embraced crypto & us launching a stable coin (which admittedly, I know little about, but it‚Äôs basically like a token that represents dollars to make transactions go faster & the US needs one). 
- big opportunity in shadow banking, the billions of people who don‚Äôt have bank accounts. Doesn‚Äôt require banking & debit card for full functionality, unlike Zelle & ApplePay. 
- good for cross-border transactions, easy & fair exchange rate. 

But despite these positives, I look at my Visa position that just seems destined to grow steadily in all markets forever. & I ask myself, is it worth buying $PYPL over adding to $V? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1280,Apple ,1

66898,15sdwcn,Intel to Call Off $5.4 Billion Tower Deal Without Chinese Approval,2023-08-16,"> Intel Corp. is expected to call off its planned $5.4 billion acquisition of Tower Semiconductor Ltd

> as time to win regulatory approval runs out

> deadline for the transaction, announced in early 2022, is midnight California time on Aug. 15 

> and the companies don‚Äôt anticipate getting approval from China by that time

not entirely unexpected as there was increasing certainty that the overall Sino-US chip tension would make this unlikely

> Investors had already discounted the chances of the deal being completed. 

> US-traded shares of Tower have declined 22% this year

> It closed Tuesday at $33.78 ‚Äî far below the $53 a share that Intel had offered. 

> even as the broader semiconductor industry saw stocks soar.

some context: 

> the purchase of the Israeli company was part of Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger‚Äôs plan to get into a faster-growing part of the semiconductor industry, the foundry market dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 

> Tower has a relatively small presence in that area ‚Äî where companies make chips for clients on a contract basis ‚Äî but has expertise and customers that Intel lacks.

> When the transaction was first announced in February of last year, Intel said it would take ‚Äúabout 12 months.‚Äù 

> As of October, the chipmaker said it was targeting the first quarter 2023

> but then in March warned that the date might slip into the second quarter. 

about Tower:

> Tower is a fraction of the size of Intel and TSMC in terms of revenue

> but it makes components for big customers such as Broadcom Inc. 

> Intel‚Äôs plan was to combine plants with Tower and tap its customer list. 

> Though Tower-made chips don‚Äôt require the state-of-the-art production techniques that an Intel or Nvidia Corp. processor demands, they serve growing markets like electric vehicles.",1838,Nvidia ,1

1. Adding r/Antiwork and r/LateStageCapitalism to our filter list. If you are a common contributor to these subreddits, your comments and submissions will only appear when approved or allowlisted by a mod.

2. Launching ""Behind the Wendy's"" a series of discussion threads talking about how moderation works behind the scenes and getting your feedback and ideas on what we're working on to make the community more interesting.

So, we haven‚Äôt had much news focused on the election yet. Yes, it‚Äôs out there but it‚Äôs not mainstream yet.

Listen it‚Äôs super simple

If NVDA does what it will probably do the tech market will rally and carry KEY tech names with it.

IF NVDA turns out to be a fraud S&P will drop to 4200 maybe even 4150 

Investor confidence will be shattered

Amazon back to 96

Google back to 87


But if NVDA CRUSHES AND RAISES EARNINGS ‚Ä¶.

Totally different story

For those who don‚Äôt understand 

They will after NVDA earnings

This isn‚Äôt financial advice‚Ä¶ it may not even be common sense‚Ä¶ 

Middle ground is NVDA beats minor guidance raise and then what happens is Jackson hole bottom maybe bottom early September steady move back up ‚Ä¶ next bottom will be these companies trying to beat next ywar estimates

Spirit already agreed to 33.50 a share from jetblue.  Current price is sub 17.  Instant near 2x upside

The DOJ sued to block the merger, but the trial starts 10/16. Historically, no airline merger deals go to trial when the DOJ sues.  All of thse lawsuits get settled out of court.  The north east alliance is dead, paving the way for a deal to be made.

Recent earnings calls by both jet blue and spirit make it sound this deal will go forward, it's just a matter of settling terms with the DOJ.

70379,15vwcwz,Do you buy the narrative?,2023-08-20,"A free market would be amazing and housing would be affordable. Free market in housing means the fed doesn‚Äôt buy HALF of all mortgage backed securities, artificially bringing the rates down to 2.5% for 30 years fixed.

A free market means the FHA doesnt exist and doesn‚Äôt let people making $25k a year buy a $250k house with 3.5% down payment,

A free market means no Fannie nor Freddie subsidizing the risk onto the taxpayer for bad loans.

A free market means treasury bonds probably pay 10% and institutions won‚Äôt even want to invest in single family housing because they can make a risk-free 10% sitting in bonds.

The only reason we have a housing bubble is that we do not have a free market. Anytime the government tries to help, it does the opposite and makes things more expensive. Healthcare used to be affordable until the government got involved in the 60s. Housing used to be affordable before all of the above shenanigans. College used to be affordable before federal student loans.

Thought experiment:

Suppose the government decided everyone deserved a smartphone. And would subsidize smartphone costs to low income phone users. Suppose when congress starts discussing this legislation lobbyists from Apple, Google, and Samsung bribe, I mean donate money to congresspeople if they write the law so the maximum phone that could be paid by the government was much higher than it needed it be for a reasonable phone.

Now also suppose simultaneously to this subsidy, the government banned new phone manufacturers and restricted phone imports to keep the total number low.

What will happen to the price of phones? Now you know what happened to housing, healthcare, and education.

last time i checked, and im super willing to be wrong on this one, large institutions own 5% of the housing market. Heres the blurb when I google it - "" Large institutions owned **roughly 5% of the 14 million single-family rentals nationally in early 2022""**

the largest one, blackstone, who BTW for all the actual dumb fucks who think Blackrock is buying all the houses blackstone is not part of blackrock, they were once under same umbrella corp but no longer. but blackstone owns 1% of the housing market.

Lol then you don‚Äôt believe in the free market. You only ‚Äúbelieve in it‚Äù when it represents your immediate short term position. When you have the choice of changing yourself or changing the system, you‚Äôd rather ruin the system than improve yourself. This is called mercantilism, crony capitalism, socialism, etc. The whole point of free market capitalism is to reject this idea.

> Otherwise you will ‚Äúown nothing and be happy‚Äù. There should be a  limit especially for institutions in profiteering off of necessities. 

What do you think a stock is? You can buy partial ownership of AirBnB, BlackRock, and any number of real estate investment trusts. Instead of owning 100% of 1 house, you own 1% of 100 houses. ‚ÄúOwn nothing and be happy‚Äù is the greatest thing ever. Except it‚Äôs a misnomer. You own nothing tangible/physical like a house or car but you own a ton of things that are intangible/digital such as shares in AirBnB and Uber. I‚Äôm happy because maintaining physical stuff is a ton of work. I just want the cash flows they generate so I can spend that money on renting stuff when I need it.

Imagine owning nothing. You rent a smartphone from Apple, rent homes and hotel rooms as you travel, get ride shares when you need them, etc. The only thing you own is a Robinhood account with millions if dollars worth of stock in Apple, Samsung, AirBnB, Marriott, BlackRock, VNQ, Uber, Tesla, Ford, Delta, etc. You spend your money to consume stuff when you want, but mostly you let other people use them and pay you for the privilege. This is why it‚Äôs called the sharing economy. Nothing sits empty and unused. Either you‚Äôre using something, or you‚Äôre getting paid to let someone else use it.",1899,Tesla Apple ,1
70360,15vwcwz,Do you buy the narrative?,2023-08-20,"There also needs to be something said about zoning and zoning laws, permits, and city councils. Part of the reason housing is such a fucking mess is because of zoning and how it can be used to prevent anything other than single family dwellings (looking at you cali). Minneapolis and St. Paul have brought inflationary numbers down below 2% and have done away with suburban zoning and allows for multi-family dwellings to be built in highly dense places which allows for more supply of housing and allows for much more affordable places.

70428,15vwcwz,Do you buy the narrative?,2023-08-20,"There are multiple factors. 

Primarily in my view is there was an underinvestment in new housing for a decade after 2007.  No body was building at a rate that accounted for population growth.  Flippers we‚Äôre fixing abandoned homes, but that was just cleaning up ‚Äúdamaged housing stock‚Äù 

By 2017 a few factors affected demand.  One of these was some bankruptcies started falling off of peoples records.  So they could now improve their credit and buy homes again after their prior foreclosures. There was also the continued low interest rates that just kept falling making Mrs affordable again. 

You mention government policies. There is a TON of NIMBYism and Zoning laws that limit high density housing.  This affects the number of new units built, especially in the more desired mature suburbs.  

I live in a mature suburb. They are only building big rental developments now in order to comply with state ‚Äúaffordable housing‚Äù rules.  The only way to ensure hosing stays reasonable is by renting to folks and limiting those by income in some of the units. 

It‚Äôs going to take some time to dig our way out of this and it will involve some legislative changes plus the effects of higher interest rates. But Seman I‚Äôd still higher then inventories right now.",1260,Amazon ,0

I've been flirting with the idea that real estate speculators had more to do with the GFC than we give credit.  We blame the big banks, who have their role to play but real estate speculators seem to have gotten off scot free.  


The speculator frenzy, low doc loans, and using liens to buy other property drives demand, drives up price, and drives bubbles.

A) Demand is crazy. Lots of rich foreigners buying up prime real estate, real estate investment trusts, people running Airbnb out of houses, and traditional generational home buyers.

B) Supply is at an all time low. Generationally, you have boomers occupying a lot of homes, and a lot of them own more than one to rent out. It doesn‚Äôt help that the Fed fucked the market with low rates so no one wants to sell right now. I could go on a tangent about building practices, but to keep it short, we mostly only build single family homes to maximize profit even though they‚Äôre not very efficient for housing. New homes as a percentage of total home sales have doubled recently. We‚Äôre not building houses faster, there‚Äôs just no supply, which is counteracting the rate hikes and keeping prices high.

C) Most of this is fixable, there‚Äôs just no incentive to. Think about a state like California. A house in San Diego costs $800K average. To make housing ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù you‚Äôd need to halve the average house price. If you halved the price of every home, people would go bankrupt left and right. Angry voters would vote out a lot of politicians in power and the state would lose a ton of money on property taxes. The government is probably hoping that changing demographics will slowly bring house prices down without crashing the market.",1474,Amazon ,0
