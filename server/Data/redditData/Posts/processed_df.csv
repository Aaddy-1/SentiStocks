61531,14hy816,Can‚Äôt go tits up,2023-06-24,"Tesla ATM put around 120 DTE is ~2300 bucks,

You have ~$25k in Tesla stock + selling an ATM call (I assume 120 DTE) which is ~2900 bucks

600 in credit, you get fucked if Tesla moons by losing out on thousands in capital gains. As far as I can tell this is a legitimate strategy, it‚Äôs just not as good as buy and hold unless you have some reason to believe Tesla is gonna tank.

Also, you numbers are off.

3 month return of ~$600 on 25k is 2.4% or 9.6% per year. 99% chance you under perform Tesla doing this in the next few years. 1% chance Elon launches a rocket into the Tesla headquarters and it pays big.

Sounds dumb. Back test it and I‚Äôm quite sure you‚Äôll see that you would have underperformed using this.

61544,14hy816,Can‚Äôt go tits up,2023-06-24,"I cannot believe the amount of incorrect bullshit being spewed in the comments so here is the right answer.

Tesla is currently trading at 256.60 (as of Friday‚Äôs close price) so going long 100 shares costs $25,660 not the 13k you mentioned.

The current fed funds rate is 5.07% and with 116 days until expiry on the 20 Oct options, your risk free return on $25,660 is $25660\*1.0507^(116/365) = $405

At this point, you might think that the $560 premium you collected is still higher than the risk free return, but remember that your synthetic short is @255, but you went long 100 TSLA shares @256.60. Therefore you lost $160 here.

560-160 = 400 which is right around the risk free return of $405.

61569,14hy816,Can‚Äôt go tits up,2023-06-24,"Humbled experience, from having done these type of trades, says that getting into and out of a ""risk-free"" trade with profit depends on liquidity and timing. TSLA has pretty-good liquidity, so there isn't much problem there with being able to enter and exit. Unlike some securities where there is only liquidity in the morning, and option positions positively won't close until they expire. (And even then, the broker somehow doesn't get ideal prices.) Also, you have to be comfortable with the platform showing huge, unrealized losses for ages, due to miss-priced options doing what they do.  
You can wait until charts start ripping across the board, and leg into a position for more profit. But the order book has to be moving steadily with no obstacles, or you will wind up managing a naked option. Cheers!",810,Tesla ,1

No secret how I feel about money, but oh wait, I don't have any secrets.  My life  is a series of stories written by evil people that spied on my life. Every time I used the bathroom, I slept with my wife or the random message to pop up while looking at porn. If I was OK with my life, secrets, and flaws being broadcast for my family and friends or supposed friends to laugh or be upset about. Stealing from me, embarrassing me at stores and banks, and forcing me to default on some bills.  Was I behind, yes? But I  was doing what I could and beginning to work on my website for stay dry (at the time I thought it a double meaning) but instead of beginning that journey people had other plans for my life. How easy it must have been for them after all they had done this to me at least twice before. Thinking back at all the times, we would laugh at my brother, and sometimes good friends would come borderline out of pocket with it. He was right. That bastard. Doesn't surprise me he is not upset.  I suppose I needed a little humbling the racy comment has some rightfully appalled. How do you defend reading the stories that are supposed to be false but are not. Sure, they are distorted a bit, but everyone present knows, and it spreads. My son, I mentioned, has been watching this show now a few days. A couple times I heard strange comments that sounded like my distorted nightmare and in shock asked for it to be turned off only to have my soon to be ex-wife laugh in anger and  as my son joined in telling me I'm crazy I turned around and went back to the room hearing them whisper about me.   I am capable of taking personal responsibility for my actions and how  I get where I end up. But nobody should be allowed to do that to someone or family. The thought of the past has me thinking maybe it would have been different, but quickly, I'm reminded of  the comments. Being narcissistic, lazy, or  the never to be forgotten spoiled kid that my son enjoyed watching with my used to be companion. That was probably coming to an end because of her addiction, but it's safe to say the continued degrading and complaining of my time on the internet has sealed the deal. I'm not sure if I'm more humble than before or just broken. I'm grateful I didn't hurt myself or anyone else. I have been alone in this losing more at every corner. Losing more money, dignity,respect,and self respect. I'm a joke in my  own home. Even in some bad times I kept some resemblance of respect at home.  Leave it to some Christians to make sure that isn't possible.  They know better and he needs to be broken and rebuilt. I  didn't sign up for the marines and people that are not qualified should not be involved in destroying families.

They can avoid paying high lease or property taxes for commercial office space.  
So housing pricing can be reduced by allowing people to move to smaller towns that have decent infrastructure instead of focusing on major cities.  
 
This also decreases energy use across the board. Traffic does down, and with that you eliminate massive amounts of carbon emissions, since people aren't sitting in traffic all over.. etc 
 
It's the cheapest and easiest solution to a lot of problems, which means it's imo the most likely.",1127,Microsoft ,0

It was working quality behind-the-scenes, deriving context and predictions from users' data on social media, those rewards points programs for which we give all our information, credit and insurance industry, disease diagnostics (and recently picking up more minute protein structure studies and genetic origins of chronic conditions), better navigation tools for international trade, and for the very smart ones, making millions in markets. The current version of ""AI"" is the LLM, which is a whole new way to collate and ""index"" data - why Pichai lit a fire under Google's ass when chatGPT came out.

This version of AI has applications on the user-end, and it will be great (might also lay off lot of wage workers, so that will be another circus to deal with). But right now, there is quite a lot of blind hype. The ""back-end"" AI won't gain from a LLM just training on petabytes of data, with billions of parameters - it needs to be much faster and more efficient than gossiping with a bot.

Of course there is much more to psychology than that, like hypes and panics. It's just one piece of the puzzle.

5. You ain‚Äôt driving cross country (especially in the south).

Still I suspect the stock to shake it off pretty quickly and move back up into the range. I continue to argue that short term vol like this is bullish. You want to see a stock digest gains and shake people out along the way. Going straight up is usually not a recipe for longer term success.

People keep talking about there needing to be a correction and then ignore the one happening right in front of them. Nvidia is now, as of this moment, down 10% off it‚Äôs high. This is also a convincing correction because a true correction has to actually correct. That is, it has to actually create a sentiment reset and scare people. You need scary headlines for that to happen.

What you never want to see after a massive run and a negative headline is most everyone immediately dismissing it (like I‚Äôm doing now) expecting further upside. What you see judging by other comments around here and fintwit about this story is the exact opposite, which is a very positive sign. Most everyone seems to expect further downside. ‚ÄúThis is finally the top and here‚Äôs a scary story to support my confirmation bias.‚Äú

Then after a long enough time of bad news not having a lasting effect and the stock going higher (accompanied by better and better news) more and more turn bullish and you‚Äôve got yourself the makings of an actual top. We‚Äôre nowhere near that from a sentiment standpoint.

For Instagram, create comics with puzzle , options to increase yours followers but Instagram takes more money on famous users. WhatsApp sell a ads message and you can have a share of the products. Metaverse , clubs to choose people like yours and earn money, virtuals products you can buy and sell more than one after but i don't know if that will be legal. A video game where you can do that with characters of super heroes and weapons, create that or sell it, and earn a plot in a war. For Facebook, it's to to propose service like lawyers, electricians and a have a commission for that.

""Every now and then, a macro event drives stocks into mars, with an army of valuation decriers.

Generative dotcom technology is fundamentally rewriting our economy.

You need an overvalued dotcom stock to make your dotcom model.

You need an overvalued dotcom stock to run your dotcom model.

You need an overvalued dotcom stock to run someone else's dotcom model.

Literally any time you see a company mention generative dotcom technology, which is gonna be every single company, they're basically announcing to the world they are giving the overvalued dotcom stock money.

There is not a single overvalued dotcom stock chip available right now. They are all accounted for the next two years.

This is based on current perception.

There's something very important in dotcom technology that you need to remember, and that is how when models get larger, they have demonstrated learning abilities that the developers did not specifically teach.

The potential for winner take all outcome is ENORMOUS with dotcom technology. FANG is fighting for their lives right now. It is not just Google.

If you are concerned about a ban on dotcom technology, know that it contributes only 20% of revenue for the overvalued dotcom stock, and there is no way it won't try to smuggle this overhyped tech at higher prices. /s Those future chips are already sold.

If you are concerned about insider sales, remember that Moderna insiders also sold all the way up, many too early.

Just like Moderna, the overvalued dotcom stock boldly gambled on an unproven technology, and the world is primed.

But the overvalued dotcom stock is not Moderna. There is no demand cliff coming.

Human species have begun building the ultimate human unchained by mortal meat, a god.

Its organs are the overvalued dotcom stock cards. TAM of divinity is infinity.

The overvalued dotcom stock is not 4090. The overvalued dotcom stock is gh200.

Elon Musk saw this in one of the slack channels

https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/031/634/guy-fired-over-meme-job-work-post-facebook-cody-hidalgo-fb.png

And he replied to it with a giant wall of text basically saying that he's 44 billion dollars in debt, made a bunch of sacrifices, and the employees are the ones making money.

But that's not all.

Elon Musk now has been going into bathrooms now and if he see's someone sitting in on the stalls, he pops his head over to talk to them about their projects in order to make sure they aren't pooping longer than necessary and stealing company time.

The meme seems to really gotten under his skin.

after Elon started doing it he bragged to mark zuckerburg about it, but then mark sent him this meme

https://i.imgflip.com/77us2q.jpg context


In the early days of facebook Mark Zuckerburg would wander into the company bathrooms and if he noticed someone sitting down in the stalls he would pop his head over and try to talk to them about their projects. Or if he was taking a poop he would host an emergency meeting and he would tell them to come over and pop their head over the stall to talk it out.

Everyone just went along with it because it was either YOLO SILICON VALLEY LMAO or they were just too intimidated.

That all stopped when Michael Moritz, legendary silicon valley investor, and one of Facebook biggest early investors and shareholders, was at the campus doing research for leading a 2nd round of funding. He was doing diligence all day and at one point had to poop and that's when Zuckerburg popped his head over with a smile to ask how's the diligence coming along.

Michael Moritz, not one to mince words, was apoplectic. 'GET THE FUCK OUT HERE YOU IDiiOT LIZARD LOOKING FUCKER.' Mark Zuckerburg nervously tried to laugh it off and persisted, because he really loved intimate poop conversations 'Aw c'mon Michael, it's silicon valley'. Zuckerburg then withdrew after Moritz flung his cellphone into his eye socket. 

30 minutes later, Mark was in a very import meeting (where he banned questions about his black eye) when Moritz walked into the conference room. 'Everyone except Mark Zuckerburg, OUT'. As intimidated as they were of Zuckerburg, at the time Moritz was the bigger deal, and they all scurried out of the room.

Zuckerburg, however, is not one to be intimated by anyone. Not the Winkewoz twins, not Eduardo Savarn, not Peter Thiel, and not one of his biggest shareholder Michael Moritz. Zuckerburg passionately defended his practice, but Michael Moritz was having none of that. Moritz told him that it was a ticking PR and HR nightmare, and threatened to pull out of leading the 2nd round of funding if Mark continued, which would have been a catastrophe for the company.

Zuckerburg pretended to arbitrate 'Ok fine, but you need to give me a good reason, because if it were normal, there would be no problem'.

Moritz was flabberghasted at this response. Was this a serious question? He answered with the most obvious answer 'Because.... it's not FUCKING NORMAL'.

Unknown to Moritz, Zuckerburg had guessed a conversation like this would happen as soon as he was kicked out of the toilet stall, and began formulating a strategy to counter Moritz demands. Zuckerburg knew that Moritz would have all the leverage, but Zuckerburg was a master strategist.

Zuckerburg went for the pounce. 'Okay, I'll lets write out an agreement, in writing I'll rescind the policy because it's not normal'. Moritz was dumbfounded, but he was used to being dumbfounded by eccentric tech founders, afterall he was also an early investor in Apple, and he still found Zuckerburg tame compared to Steve Jobs. Moritz had a long day of work so they signed the agreement so that he could go back to doing his due diligence.

When Moritz left, a broad grin spread across Zuckerburg's face. "" 'Not Normal' eh? "" Zuckerburg said with a menacing laugh. Ever since then, Mark Zuckerburg has been on a life-long crusade to normalize poop conversations.

He had a checklist of what he needed to accomplish in order to realize this. His advisors would tell him it's impossible, but one by one Zuckerburg checked off the list. From normalizing smart phone use on the toilet (actually a collaboration between Mark Zuckerburg and Steve Jobs), to trusting Mark with their private photos, to normalizing people giving up their internet browsing privacy.

In 2015, Zuckerburg knew he would hit a wall, having people watch you while you poop was still too much of a leap. That's when Zuckerburg decided to buy Occulus, and eventually shift his company towards virtual reality. If he could coax people into having life-like conversations while they were pooping in a virtual reality, then doing it in the real world wouldn't be too big of a leap.

Do you read facebook or instagram while you're pooping? Ever consider what urges you to do that? It's not your personal preference, it's by Mark Zuckerburg's design.

Zuckerburg only has 3 more boxes to check off before poop conversations are normalized.

Mark Zuckerburg wants to watch you poop.

Are you going to let him?

EDIT, UPDATE

I just got this in my DM. 

>I am a ex Facebook worker. Everything you said rings true. I speak to you at the risk of consequences for breaking my NDA. When I was at Facebook I was involved in a program called Project PooPal. Mark Zuckerburg was planning on Meta entering the exploding tele-therapy space, but targeting people who are not ready to talk to an actual person. You talk to a virtual reality therapist who responds with what is described as the greatest AI (though whatever you tell it, it only responds with 'wow, tell me more'). The thing is, the virtual reality assistant has a striking resemblance to Mark Zuckerburg himself. But the most damning aspect is that it's supposed to used only when you're pooping. This feature is described as optional, though uses the most advanced AI for your phone camera to check if you're actually on a toilet, and if not, says 'It looks like you're not pooping. Please start pooping and try again'. I always wondered what is the purpose and origin of the project. Now I know.",6213,Tesla Apple Meta ,1

The decline in home prices is a sign that the housing market is cooling off after a period of rapid growth.

Although house-buying affordability fell to its lowest level since November, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, home prices have not dropped as much as economists anticipated. This is because higher mortgage rates have made current homeowners less willing to sell, resulting in fewer homes available in the market.

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures home prices across the nation, fell 0.2% in April, compared with a 0.7% annual growth rate the prior month. The annual decline was the first for the index since April 2012.

Third-party sellers try crazy prices on Amazon to take advantage of shortage rumors, social media nonsense, and just plain regards.

So I just checked, and there‚Äôs an Amazon seller offering a 3-pack of 20Oz for 28.59. That‚Äôs $9.53/ea still expensive but not $70.

Think I‚Äôd just drive up the road to Kroger, if I didn‚Äôt have it in the fridge.

Or I could go to 168 or H-Mart and pick from a dozen brands from US, Thailand, Viet Nam, etc.  if they should somehow be out of Huy Fong. If I didn‚Äôt have a recently-bought bottle in the fridge.

50775,14lsr2n,Are we in a bubble ? Are you a bull or bear?,2023-06-29,"This year, the stock market has experienced significant growth. People have been excitedly discussing the potential of AI, experiencing FOMO (fear of missing out), and expressing doubt about the Federal Reserve‚Äôs hawkish stance. It seems like everyone wants to replicate the phenomenal rise of Tesla in 2020.

However, it‚Äôs important to recognize that our current situation is different from 2020. We no longer have an infinite money supply or the same level of quantitative easing. Instead, we are facing tightening credit conditions, an impending recession (acknowledged by economists), and concerns about overvaluation and stretched valuations.

The bullish sentiment has created an imbalance in the market, and it‚Äôs time to capitalize on this opportunity. We are just 8% away from the market‚Äôs previous peak, which occurred during a time of near-perfect economic conditions and unprecedented growth. It‚Äôs worth noting that the United States has never experienced significant growth under tight economic conditions like the ones we are currently facing. Leading indicators are signaling a weakening economy.

By acknowledging the realities of our situation and recognizing the potential risks, we can make informed decisions and take advantage of the market inefficiencies created by the bullish rhetoric. It‚Äôs crucial to approach this with a level-headed perspective, considering both the exciting opportunities and the challenges we may encounter along the way.",1466,Tesla ,0

Absolutely not we're not even at ATH. If we go up 400% in 2 years and bear as\*holes are stretched to the maximum it would be a bubble. We're at best about 10% overvalued but more likely around fair value.

>It seems that a lot of people claimed that we were supposed to be in a recession .. I don‚Äôt think we are as it has not impacted me or anyone around me . 

It's a bit paradoxical but the main reason why I also don't believe in a recession is that every place is searching for workers. Everyone is hiring.

>If I remember correctly Carvana should be bankrupt . Nividia is mooning , I think it‚Äôs over valued . Apple aswell . 

Some companies are overvalued regardless if someone makes money but people don't actually make valuation estimations here but just go by a quick google and gut feeling.

>With this said, I wonder what you guys thought about the market is ? Do you think we are in a ‚Äú bubble ‚Äú ? During Covid everything went up super high to the moon , and then it went down hard . Will it happen again or did we recover and everything is back to normal ? 

I already said it during end of last year. Summer is the only chance bears have to reach 2022 lows again but now we may see ""only"" a drop of maximum 10% and end of year we rally because negative surprises run out. We would need to enter a severe recession now to go back to old lows because basically every year that we go down or stay flat makes it harder and harder to bet on a downtrend because earnings pile up and you can't downgrade future growth forever.",1555,Apple Google ,0

I fully agree, they missed last year's sales expectations by just a handful of cars. They came up with an in-house solution for a critical part that was backlogged in Germany slowing production. So production is likely moving ahead. It feels like they are on a similar path as Tesla, they had years where no one ever thought they would pass 100k cars produced, and now they are making hundreds of thousands a quarter.

The bad competition has filed for bankruptcy, so fewer players move the funds from the failures and into the credible companies. They make high quality vehicles that are spreading in popularity.

Of course there would be a huge support for Tesla with a  culture like this one.

Mining companies like Glencore founded by Belgian ""traders"" name Marc Rich - literally Rich was his last name and he died in 2013 right around the same time it started becoming public knowledge that Congolese children were being exploited and trafficked into mining cobalt for the electric car industry so companies like Tesla and CEO's like Elon Musk could continue benefitting from the age old tradition of robbing Africans blind, started way back with King Leopold II going right into the Congo, declaring the territory and resources and entire people as his own like a mad God King Butcher and he ends up massacring millions of innocent men, women, and children mostly for resisting his rule.

The King was from Belgium, didn't give up the land and died a terrible tyrant with a permanent legacy as long as Glencore continues mining operations in the Congo and exploiting the descendants of the SURVIVORS of tyranny. 

Think about it, you have a bunch of Congolese families growing up in a mining zone that once was a lush and beautiful wilderness landscape teeming with exotic animals and birds and flora and fauna, natural water that was safe to drink and children were able to travel and explore and grow and move beyond their borders.

Now it's a mining colony filled with imported mercenary groups, Tech companies, mining conglomerates, Chinese dictatorship controlled military industrial complex NORINCO is setting up a base officially now. You have White Supremacy and racism to thank for the destruction of the Congo and their natural habitat, you have people getting extremely wealthy like Elon Musk and Tesla investors and Glencore participants all the same getting rich while covering up their lunacy with religions and fantasy based misinformation keeping innocent Congolese children from growing up healthy and happily, from offering them the same opportunities Marc Rich's parents attempted to offer him when they ""escaped"" from the Nazi's only to raise one of the worst ones of them all in the end it turns out no matter how hard you run from Nazi's you can't escape their grooming techniques, can't get passed the broken economic system that seems to enable a version of human beings beyond the rest with cultures all over the world united in weird cringeworthy holidays that celebrate fat white bearded blue eyed men dressed in red, or celebrate racist dictator tyrants that are long since dead and buried but still we honor their memory by keeping gigantic statues of them around and refusing to label them in the history books for what they truly were..",3113,Tesla Apple ,0

Right now, no telling if it just goes to 200 then blasts off, hits 200 and immediately sells off or if it just stays in a 185-200 range.  If you are planning to play puts because of this so called non-stop rally, you'd be better off and have more conviction to just wait till you see every pop get shorted and gapping down on open and having \[consistent\] down trend days.  If/when that happens, along with more recession talk and inflation picking back up news, thats when you pile in hard.  

Buying puts now on no sign of topping out yet is like trying to short AAPL last Friday, won't work out too well and you'll end up selling for a loss when your options are down 30-40% in a week or two.  Several EOY price targets at $220 anyway, which doesn't help your case.",847,Apple ,0

I was thinking of making this post:

AMD and NVDA move in unison. Almost all major companies move in similar trend. 

In what world should TSLA move 2% if NVDA is? Who buys them at exact same time?

Two days ago AMD and NVDA were in almost perfect synchrony. NVDA moved $1 for every 0.30-0.40 cents AMD moved. Their charts looked almost identical.

You ever wonder why YTD all the major tech stocks are up? Go look at the graphs. 

The whole market jumped today? Who buys NVDA at $420? Is there someone with big money stupid enough to buy an over hyped stock, enough to move the price up? Even wall street apes know better.

This is manipulation. Market manipulation. You're not up against other investors, you're up against manipulators. The price is what they say it is.

My guess is they price fix. Meaning, they set a price bracket and people buy and sell in that bracket. All the volume take place in that bracket. 

Next possibility is they pump money into major stocks at a fixed rate throughout the day. This explains why something like AMD and NVDA moved in unity. There's no way in a free market the two stocks move almost identically. They should be sloppy and choppy.

Just no, this is not fair. There's no integrity in the markets. They're holding this shit up artificially. Left on its own NVDA would probably be $150.

Know you're up against manipulators, not other investors. If you have more info share so we can get to the bottom of this.

Where's the SEC? My guess is they're behind it. Them, the federal government and other people in power.

Edit:

This is manipulation at its finest. Our stocks are not worth this much. They're holding the prices up. You don't think someone holding NVDA would sell after it jumped to $421 from $401? 

They have buttons to move prices in any direction they choose.

This is orchestrated. Stocks don't need to move in unity. Look at the charts.

ADBE, MSFT, AAPL, META, TSLA, AMD, NVDA, AMZN and other ones all jumped over night. This is not a retail investor move.

The inversion and what you described is way off. If you‚Äôre taking about the 2-10s spread obv that  happens simply because the rate of trust in gov debt currently is low and institutions and individuals will prefer low duration over long duration. Secondly, the Fed will not lower rate as fast as you and others think. They will first raise the standard 2% inflation target to 3 or even 4. Were anchoring to higher for longer, and all last year the cutting crowd or pivot crowd keeps getting burned.

There will be a no cut this year, we will be in 70s style rates for longer, defaults will occur but again it‚Äôs not systematic it‚Äôs domestic, and then they raise the anchor. 

Commercial re is a problem but VCs and PE will restructure, they always do with the magnitude of re in their portfolios. Distressed re debt is going to be a bull market into late 2025.

France non event - just noise. Macron may get recalled but this has no effect on US markets and this is not the PIGS protests in EU debt crisis on 2016. Not even close. 

Labor will crack soon given the fed stated unequivocally they won‚Äôt stop and there will be pain in the labor markets. 

The camp now is no landing and this is foolish. We will be in a low to no growth period for a few years, markets will consolidate locally with maybe a few 2 standard dev moves in sectors , and then we cut given defaults, and job losses come about in q1 2024.

TLDR: all is well and rates will  be higher for longer. No pivot, fed will reset to 3% inflation anchor mandate, major job losses and defaults in 2024. Fed cuts into election peak",1600,Apple ,0
59507,14nr7nl,"Interest rates, inflation and yield curve inversion. Part II.",2023-07-01,"It seems like you have strong concerns about the current economic situation and potential risks in various sectors. Economic predictions and market trends can be complex and multifaceted, making it challenging to predict the exact outcome. It's important to consider a range of factors, including macroeconomic indicators, monetary policy, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment.

While it's reasonable to assess potential vulnerabilities in commercial real estate, household debt, and certain companies, it's also crucial to note that the overall economic landscape is influenced by a variety of factors. Central banks and policymakers often respond to economic conditions and adjust their strategies accordingly.

When discussing interest rates, inflation, and yield curve inversions, it's essential to approach the topic with a comprehensive understanding of the global economic environment. Economic cycles, market fluctuations, and unforeseen events can impact these factors and influence outcomes.

It's always advisable to diversify investments, conduct thorough research, and consider long-term investment strategies based on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide valuable insights tailored to your specific situation.

I may not ever sell all my shares, but due to always holding *some*, I've been able to ""play with house money"" off NVDA for 5+ years and buy other stocks while keeping NVDA shares. 

I've been an NVDA investor for closer to 8 years, but there was a 3-4 month window where I sold all my NVDA shares about 6ish years ago after they went from $25-$125. Bought back in around $220 before the 4-1 split...so, the cost equivalent of ~$55 for today's share price and have held most of those ever since.

I made 5x off the first time I bought it and I sold it all. Bought back in, and it has now gone up ~8x from that. It's been a fucking winner...I just wish I had bought more initially lol.

In an alternate universe, where EVs are a myth and gasoline is the nectar of the gods, these Bears üêª might have been the Wall Street soothsayers. But alas! We live in a world where the hum of an electric motor drowns out the growls of these naysayers.

You could almost hear the panicked whispers in the wind, 'Can we short-circuit these electric machines?'

Ladies and gents, grab your popcorn üçø and enjoy this spectacle as the Bears scramble to make sense of a future that's electric, bright and filled with more Teslas than they ever dared to imagine.

But the market is not necessarily indicating a bull flag. Similarly at times of extreme fear, very often short term long positions are a bad idea as the reversal is temporary as part of a bigger move down. Last all time high the index was around 94. It can‚Äôt go more than 100 as it‚Äôs an oscillator based on several pieces of data that can only reach 100. It can stay there for a period of time. This would indicate the market continues to climb without rest. Which would be a very rare if not impossible occurrence.

But holy shit, bezos, gates, musk..   these guys changed the world in positive ways, the valuation behind their names is because they made human lives easier, better, or will be doing so in the future.  SpaceX making delivering goods to space significantly cheaper than NASA, and thus making things like starlink and general exploration move up in the grand scheme of things is a net positive for humanity.   I don't believe we will see mass adoption of EVs because I don't believe we have anywhere near the infrastructure to support it.. but the ball is now rolling. Bezos, the Walton's, etc made goods for the average consumer cheap and convenient. That imo is detrimental to the economy (people bitch CONSTANTLY about wage stagnation, yet send as much of their money as humanly possible direct to foreign entities and manufacturers just to save a buck cutting out the local middleman, then wonder why there's no money in their local economy to pay them more money every year) but you can't sit there and say ""these people did nothing"".

Buuuuut, Tesla vehicle quality is SHIT as is their service.

Opening up their network will just accelerate their loss of market share for vehicles. After I finally sell my MX and MS, i will gladly buy EV from a reputable automaker and use their charging network.

As far as Q2, the hit that # only after ?8? Price cuts this year.  Their margin is going into the gutter.  Big Auto can afford losses for a lot longer than Tesla can.  

Before you go off about the $20B cash / ~0 debt for Tesla, look at the balance sheet again, especially their short term liabilities.  Literally all that cash is offset by AP, etc.

It's too bad Tesla didn't license their tech years ago and just switch to energy.  Far less headache and the money is in the recurring revenue anyway.",804,Tesla ,0

34422,14p52te,"tesla will continue to be the dominant ev leader, here‚Äôs why",2023-07-03,"You are missing a few things:

1: Tesla vehicles are terrible quality vehicles. Always have and to this day still do rank among the lowest quality vehicles you can buy. Touch screen issues, missing paint, missing features, interior paneling with gaps and some things just not installed at all. And Tesla is still having issues with these things

2: Teslas are just now starting to get onto the used car market, and the trend will only increase over the next few years. And with the requirement to buy a new battery, and with the previously mentioned quality issues, I suspect these will sell for much cheaper than when the original owners bought them. 

3: Although this secondary market may be great for the brand, it does nothing for Tesla‚Äôs bottom line. And because of their price-point for the poor quality and increased competition on the market, Tesla will indeed lose some of their original adopters to competitors with better quality and reliability. We already see this forcing them to cut prices.

34423,14p52te,"tesla will continue to be the dominant ev leader, here‚Äôs why",2023-07-03,This post misses the biggest issue with Tesla. Their cars have not changed the way they look in what over ten years? Once GM and Ford are pumping out EV‚Äôs they‚Äôre going to be doing their model updates all the time like we currently do. I also saw some stats somewhere that a very low percentage of Tesla owners buy another Tesla. Mainly cause the quality is so low. With GM Ford and VW adding quality made and fresh vehicles to their EV lineups‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt see the Elon Dan boys being enough. Only good point you made is with the chargers.

They have overexpanded and most people are realizing that they want a quality product instead.  There are both cheaper and higher quality competitors and the amount of competition will only increase with time.  Teslas stock is at a valuation that assumes they will continue to expand forever and be the only option in the industry.  Eventually that paradigm will change and Elon will have already sold at the top again and holders will be fucked.,542,Tesla ,1

The dataset is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOFa57YtfnhEItb6-vG9Ak7clGlLBJXS_Nn7tMwRTYg/edit#gid=0). 

The spread has been inverted since 11/10. That is 154 days in a row. There is no other instance in history where the spread inverted and a recession did not follow. And especially not after having been inverted for over 150 days. 

[Here is a list of past recessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States).

23181,14qysi4,Mortgage catastrophe brews in Britain as millions are pushed toward insolvency,2023-07-05,"Banks are cunning about losses and regulators/governments aid them in it. 

There are *millions* of reposssed properties all over Spain from 2009, still sitting empty or occupied by squatters. The houses and apartments slowly falling to pieces. 

I wondered why the banks don't sell them and cut their losses, then realised that cut of their balance sheet would destroy them, with the contagion spreading across the EU. 

So they just stay as assets on the balance sheet at repo value, not what they're worth now, which is maybe 50% of that, at best. 

There's a house on my street, currently occupied by squatters, house is 6 bed, 5 bath, big bastard. Was probably very nice back in 2009. Now it's slowly becoming a shell. The bank can't even be bothered to expedite eviction because it costs more money. So every few years, the process drags on, squatters out, new squatters break in. The house slowly crumbling. Was probably worth 700k in 2009. Now you'd be lucky to get 300 but most people wont buy a big 'fixer upper'  here as you need cash for the renovation. Banks wont lend 200% LTV etc. Now multiply that % loss by millions of properties. Shit, there's gotta be 30+ big houses just in my area, near Barcelona, not some tourist backwater. 

There are entire urbanisations of apartments and houses sitting empty, never lived in, in Andalusia. Think, 1000 properties... With working traffic lights, overgrown weeds everywhere etc, like the film 'I am legend', its very surreal. No one lives there. No ones ever lived there. I used to rip my old bmw round one when I lived there, like a shit Ken Block. 

Some banks bother to brick up the doors and windows to stop the squatters, so that's something, I guess. 

This giant can kick is all Spanish banks.  Not sure how they get out of it. Don't bother shorting though as the governments since, both centre right and the current hippies, have allowed it to roll on, never mentioning it. 

I think it's enough to bring down a couple of big banks here and the government and lefty population, either can't afford or will tolerate, a bailout.",2092,Microsoft ,0

Deliveries beat is great. Lower margins is +/- depending on overall volume compared to decreased margins. I'm interested to see the revenue from selling driver data. TSLA, by far, has the largest collection of autonomous driving data and that continues to grow. 

The combination of growing market share, increased data collection + sales, and global push for EV's is setting up a runway for continued accelerated growth.

23187,14qysi4,Mortgage catastrophe brews in Britain as millions are pushed toward insolvency,2023-07-05,"UK here. 

Mortgages are fine. 

Most people take fixed term mortgages. So a mortgage won't just implode. And banks don't charge the base rate (if only) and already factor in rate rises into risk analysis when determining their rates. 

The people that will get fucked are those that were already paying too big a percentage of their wages and were stupid enough to only take a short fixed term of 2 years or whatever and are now due to remortgage. 

Depending where they're at they're looking at up to doubling their current mortgage payments. ON TOP of our still awful inflation.

So if someone was paying a third of their wages or more on their mortgage they're fucked. That's now 66% to 100% of their wages. Except the remaining 33% at the low end is still fucked because of inflation. Basically bills are now going to be over 100% of wages. Fun times. 

I'm also personally fucked because I'm looking to buy in the near future. If rates don't come back down over the next couple of years I'm fucked unless the housing market crashes (which it could). Financial we're ok now but have the opposite problem. We can now only afford a house worth half what we could previously. Which severely limits our options.

Rentals are even more fucked for landlords. 

Taking on a new property or remortgaging means double mortgage payments compared to previous. But obviously there's pressure not to just double rents and you can't just do it willy nilly anyway. But the fun part.. the hilarious part?..

They're changing tax laws for landlords. Instead of being taxed on profit (rent minus mortgage) they will no longer be allowed to do that offset. They will be taxed on 100% of rent. Even if after a mortgage rise they're only keeping 10% of the money as profit. Taxes could end up being higher than yield for some landlords. 

So.. fuck loads are getting out. The rental market is about to get decimated at the same time. 

I'm just watching the chaos hoping our housing market crashes. Sorry for all the people that'll go into negative equity and all but I want a house damn it.

I will note that only Tesla's FSD is being evaluated and there is nothing to my knowledge going on with Waymo, GM or Ford.  This despite the very small number of accidents where Autopilot was activated. You would THINK that the government would need to certify self-driving and even driver assist features with some standardized and published  testing methodology (ala UL) but they allow the manufacturer to self-certify.

As soon as you get on any side streets that don‚Äôt have well defined lanes and painted lines, it can get pretty sketchy. 

Also there‚Äôs roads that might have speed limits of 25 or 35mph that literally no one drives those speeds on. You become a liability on those roads when there‚Äôs people behind you trying to drive normally and you‚Äôre crawling along an extended stretch at 25mph.

I stumbled across wsb in 2018 when everyone was blowing stupid money on spy 280c FDs, and was instantly hooked. I actively followed this sub over the following years and learnt a ton about options, the markets, finance etc. WSB was truly interesting to me, and was one of the primary decisions in my decision to study finance alongside my other degree.

  
however, finance in university is very different to finance on wallstreetbets. This important difference lead to my interest in my finance degree dropping to about zero. I stopped going to the lectures, but still did the tests. Even though I didnt study whatsoever, with the knowledge I gained from reading WSB (yes, seriously) I unironically was able to wing all my units and pass. I even got one of the top marks in the intro to options theory unit, funnily enough. 

  
recently I finished my finance degree, and although I do hate finance, I realised I really do like the markets and trading, and I intend to keep playing around in the markets, just not pursue a career in it.

22884,14sgnx9,On a nice run. $105k realized profit in 3 months. Bullish on PTON and RUN next if anybody wants to hit the casino with me,2023-07-06,"
I‚Äôve been involved in fitness, both as an athlete and as a coach or trainer for a number of years.

PTON is a company with almost no real value to it. Ppl like their trainers but the hardware is really no different than any other bike. They need to keep ppl subscribed or there is no business. 

I called this beat down at the start of the pandemic when it went public and everyone thought it was going to the moon. They started giving ppl cheap subscriptions to buy the bike. The churn was going to be real and the bikes would get turned into expensive shirt racks. It happens all the time with anything at home fitness. Some become hard core but most ppl require others to stay motivated on track. 

The key moment for me was when they refused to admit any fault when their treadmill killed a kid. They basically blamed the kid and parents for not using it correctly. Hubris is a huge red flag. 

Next they came out and said they wouldn‚Äôt need any more capital raises and then less than a month later they came out with a cap raise. They were either lying or too incompetent to know. Either way it‚Äôs a red line to cross. The entire board, CEO and CFO deserved to be fired for that before the news even broke. 

The key for any value to be extracted from PTON is for someone like maybe Apple to come in and buy them up, likely with the caveat that certain high level trainers stay on for a certain period with the promise of profit sharing, a la Messi.",1454,Apple ,1

1. Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory will stop production on the battery production line 1 period, and lay off employees.

2. Part of the reason is that production line 2 period will soon go into production to replace line 1 period.

3. At the same time, Model 3 and Model Y will use battery packs provided by Ningde Times, which also led to some of Tesla's battery production outsourcing to battery suppliers.

4. Tesla's approach is intended to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

Ford Lightning is the closest competition I think, but range is not that great? Not sure how many they've built.

And Amazon getting Rivian vans is very very positive.

&#x200B;

They have enough cash to go through the recession (they diluted the shareholders recently, Dec 2022), I'm not 100% sure if they'll be cash flow positive soon, and that's the major risk with Rivian, getting free cashflow positive and keep growing like Tesla did.

**Cannabis is a bad investment decision.**

The cannabis market is expected to grow as legalization continues, but its projected growth rates underperform many other sectors. The problem is that investing into any cannabis based business is extremely dangerous due to the impact and volatility that industrialization has had on the industry.

Distributors are the safest bet for investments in this sector, but they are still very risky because they operate in a competitive and established market *where supply already existed*. (Where do you think people got their weed from before?)

Rare earth metals/mining are smart to invest in though. If you throw money at rare earths though, you might as well also get your toes wet in tech stocks, since most of them produce finished products that come from rare earth metals.",952,Meta ,0

To put it another way, imagine how dull WSBs would be if there were no gay bears on here? Or conversely, no regarded bulls?

Elon is constantly stirring debate like a shit stirrer stirs shit. Yes he cops a lot of flack personally, but that's the point. Anyone who wants to mock or ridicule Elon can go to the company he paid 40bills for and have at him. It's fantastic. 

What does Zuck ever say that's inflammatory? He just invades your privacy for profit.

A lot of people saw the banking crisis being really really bad (but 2008!!!) and possibly didn‚Äôt believe Jerome and friends would do whatever it took to stop it during QT.

But oops they basically came in and said ‚Äúwe will literally do anything necessary, our friends at the big banks can buy all the small banks good assets for dirt cheap, and we will also do a little surprise balance sheet increases‚Äù

People thought the banking crisis would be bad but the FED said ‚Äúno lol the rigged compounding machine that is the market can‚Äôt go down further after we created a soft landing‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt understand how people don‚Äôt get this. The compounding machine is a given to go up and always follows the FEDs plans. 

It took them *1.5 months* during the Covid crash which should have lasted years to turn the machine around. 

They told us they were looking for a soft landing, no way in hell they‚Äôd let it go any lower after the banking crisis.",957,Apple ,0

Not only were we charged for the new line and phones, which we *didn‚Äôt receive*, it fucked up our current phones because two of our numbers were switched to these new phones *we did not ask for or receive* and made our actual phones useless. 

This shit lasted for months of support saying they couldn‚Äôt see it, that it was being escalated to the tech team, that it was resolved. 

I must have spent 100 hours on the phone over 3 months, every single time having to go through the same bullshit with an idiot support agent who I knew couldn‚Äôt help me, asking the same questions as last time. 

These fucks wouldn‚Äôt even tell me who ordered the phones or where. It requires a fucking signature. Is my identity stolen? What the fuck is going on? How do you *not know*, AT&T?

They say they take ‚Äúnotes‚Äù but they don‚Äôt, they had no details of any previous times we contacted support. They‚Äôre full of shit.

63815,14waon6,Curious what's going on with At&T,2023-07-10,There‚Äôs some highly regarded takes on ATTin the comments. I was just reading that ATT got an upgrade last week. What people don‚Äôt understand is that utilities and telecom are long term investments with quarterly dividends. The stock Looks to be oversold and or over shorted. When ATT cut their dividend from 6% to 4% and cut revenue forecasts all of the dividend mutual funds dumped the stock because they only hold stocks with 5% or more dividend yield in their fund.  After q1 earnings ATT tried to stimulate buyers and entice mutual funds to buy back into their portfolios by offering a special cash dividend which would have brought the yield back up to 5%. Every research firm has this at a buy according to yesterdays reports. I‚Äôd see if it goes any lower based on next weeks rate hikes then pick some up at 13.50 research firms still forecasts this to be a $25 price target through year end.  This company is more than just cell phone revenue. They have the fastest fiber internet packages and they have quarterly revenue from their 30% ownership in warner brothers discovery. So plenty of revenue to be had outside of iPhone sales.,1139,Apple ,1

65647,14w7cmk,Question on call options from a beginner trader,2023-07-10,"Playing ERs with options is effectively like playing odds/evens on a roulette wheel. For this metaphor we will say odds are buying puts, and evens are buying calls. You could play evens, the ball lands on 32 (stock soars) and you get a big payout. You could also play evens, the ball lands on 0 (stock rises but not more than implied volatility expects) and even though technically 0 is an even number and you were correct about directional movement, 0 is not considered even in roulette and you get screwed (IV crush).",519,Meta ,1

37714,14w8228,Rally totally justified. Only up from here.,2023-07-10,"Here‚Äôs some other things to consider:

‚ÄúAmazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and NVIDIA are expected to be the largest contributors to earnings growth for the S&P 500 for Q4 2023. ‚Ä¶ If these four companies were excluded, the estimated earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 for Q4 2023 would fall to 4.2% from 8.2%.‚Äù

https://insight.factset.com/what-is-driving-the-expected-rebound-in-sp-500-earnings-growth-in-q4-2023?hs_amp=true

So, if you remove the top performers to date, you also remove most of the S&P earnings growth. 

Stated another way, they‚Äôre up because they‚Äôre the only stocks growing earnings. 

Nor is this new.

Since 2002, the EPS for the ‚Äúinformation technology‚Äù sector has increased by 10x.

https://www.yardeni.com/pub/peacocksp500.pdf

That‚Äôs leaps and bounds over any other sector, eg financials are basically flat over that time.

And if you think I‚Äôm being cute with timeframes, I‚Äôm not. Pick whatever timeframe the result is the same.

Another:

S&P profit margins since ~1992, have gone from about 6%, to about 11%. Call it 2x.

By comparison, IT, they‚Äôve expanded margins from about 5% to north of 20%, aka 4x.

Again, no other sector is even remotely close.

Now the shiny is wearing off, and you see them everywhere, they are starting to be seen as what they are: a poorly made electric car that's referred to as the California Camry. Sure they aren't going away any time soon, and I wouldn't bet against them. But I don't think comparing EV's from long-established ICE companies to solely EV-producing brands is apples to apples. Ford is still a Ford, and I love Ford. I own 2. But I couldn't give two shits about an electric F-150. All I see is ""F-150."" Just like every other flavor of Ford. Every car on the road has either ""ECO"" or ""Hybrid"" or ""Hydra-cooled, nucleo-fission flex fuel 95"" on it, nowadays. I don't know what the hell they are. I just see the brand, and I couldn't care less if it's ICE or not. Now, when you see something radically different, it has appeal. That's what Tesla had going for it -radically different. Now it's not so much radically different, and social movers will move on to premium EV's like from Rivian that are harder to get (principle of scarcity).

60150,14vvccc,"$MSOS $TLRY $CURLF ""Germany Unveils Draft Bill To Legalize Cannabis"" - Forbes",2023-07-10,"Germany's government is taking steps toward the legalization of  cannabis by publishing the draft bill for the first pillar of a  two-pillar model designed to dismantle prohibition policies.

German's Ministry of Health published on July 5 the long-waited [draft bill](https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/themen/cannabis/faq-cannabisgesetz-entwurf.html#collapse_control_6771)  to regulate the use of cannabis for personal use, home growing, and the  establishment of cannabis growers' associations designed similarly to  the cannabis social clubs' model.

The proposed legislation aims to address the first pillar of a  comprehensive two-pillar model that will put an end to cannabis  prohibition in the European country.

Under the draft bill, adults aged 18 and above will be allowed to  possess up to 25 grams of cannabis for personal use and cultivate a  maximum of three plants. However, the consumption of cannabis in the  ""immediate vicinity"" of individuals under 18, within a 200-meter radius  of schools, children's and youth facilities, playgrounds, publicly  accessible sports facilities, and pedestrian zones between 7 am and 8  pm, will remain prohibited. It's important to note that fines and  criminal charges will continue to be imposed for specific unlawful  activities.

The draft bill also laid the foundations for the establishment of cannabis growers' associations (*Anbauvereinigungen*).

The proposed legislation allows an association to accept up to 500  members. Each member belonging to the association is eligible to receive  either 25 grams per day or 50 grams per month for personal use.  Additionally, associations have the authority to supply each member with  a maximum of seven seeds per month, which can be imported, or five  cuttings per month.

The consumption of cannabis will be prohibited inside associations  and within a 200-meter distance from their entrance. Additionally,  associations are prohibited from engaging in any form of advertising or  sponsoring their activities.

Germany's state governments have the authority to regulate the number  of associations permitted in a district or urban area by issuing  ordinances with a maximum limit of one association per 6,000  inhabitants.

But what is a real game-changer for Germany is the removal of cannabis from the Narcotics Drugs Act (*Bet√§ubungsmittelgesetz*,  BtMG) and other related laws. This move grants the medical cannabis  industry more flexibility, although it should be noted that the proposed  legislation does not alter the existing medical cannabis industry  substantially. Instead, it primarily focuses on improving access to  medical cannabis by allowing patients to obtain a regular cannabis  prescription rather than a specialized narcotic prescription for their  medication.

The draft bill related to the second pillar of Germany's  legalization model will be published in the second half of 2023 after  being reviewed by the European Commission, and it will be about regional  pilot projects with commercial supply chains, likely following the  model in [Switzerland](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2022/08/23/switzerland-to-launch-europes-first-cannabis-sales-pilot-program/?sh=2b5a405e440d) and the [Netherlands](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2023/02/27/netherlands-to-kick-off-legal-cannabis-sale-pilot-program/?sh=66faa7bb4399).

Overall, the two-pillar model planned by the German government to  legalize cannabis for personal use in the country aims to address public  health protection, prevention, and education about the use of cannabis,  curb the illicit market, and strengthen child and youth protection.

Whether this model can effectively achieve these goals remains to be  seen. It needs to be taken into consideration that Germany initially had  an [ambitious plan to legalize cannabis](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2022/10/28/germany-reveals-how-it-wants-to-legalize-cannabis/?sh=636d90166cef)  in the country by building up a commercial supply chain for adult-use  cannabis with a potential tax revenue of billions of dollars, which  would have made it the first European country to legalize the sale of  cannabis.

However, it has then faced the legal hurdles of international and  European laws that don't allow access to cannabis for recreational use.  Although the international treaties could have had less impact in terms  of legal consequences, as seen in the cases of Uruguay and Canada, the  breach of EU laws on narcotics could lead to severe sanctions. This is  why [the German government revised its plan](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2023/04/13/what-to-know-about-germanys-revised-plan-to-legalize-cannabis/?sh=7fdc741325e0) and introduced a draft bill that aligns more with European laws by excluding the commercial sales of cannabis products.

By adopting a non-commercial model to legalize cannabis in the  country, Germany could become the third EU member to regulate personal  use, following in the footsteps of Malta and [Luxembourg](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2023/06/29/luxembourg-legalizes-cannabis-for-personal-use/?sh=6e9e71f01ce8).

But the importance of legalization in Germany lies in the fact that  more European countries could follow a similar model, triggering other  countries to pursue cannabis regulation. This has already happened in  the [Czech Republic](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2022/11/04/the-czech-republic-plans-to-legalize-cannabis-in-coordination-with-germany/?sh=720ef86d77e4), which announced its intention to legalize cannabis after Berlin.

Furthermore, the establishment of regional pilot projects in Germany  following the European Commission's review, could trigger other EU  countries to consider experimenting with the controlled sale of cannabis  products. This would allow them to assess the effects of full  legalization. However, it will be up to the EU to review its laws  regarding the regulation of recreational cannabis sales within member  countries.

But for now, it will be up to Germany to successfully implement the draft legislation and put it into effect.

The Ministry of Health's draft bill is expected to be approved by the  cabinet by August. Following that, the law would need to be passed by  the *Bundestag*, the German federal parliament. Therefore, a decision on cannabis legalization could potentially be made this year.",6761,Amazon ,0

>There‚Äôs no way I explain this as elegantly as Margot Robbie in a bathtub so I know you degenerates will roll your eyes and move on, but I want to be able to say I called it in the future. I believe a combination of fomo, bad debit deals, and overhyped delivery beats has sent Tesla to unrealistic and unsustainable heights. Day after day FSD starts to look more like a legal and regulatory liability than a future asset. The Tesla truck (most hyped release of this year) is already old news and they have yet to start moving them. Competition from the F-150 lightning and others is not just catching up‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs here. Sure they sold an extra 5% cars, easy to do if you discount 20%. Let's not even start talking about the companies valuation compared to Toyota (enough has been said on that). It‚Äôs lunacy, fuelled by nothing but greed and pie in the sky goals for 2030. Also a large amount of shares are also still being used as leverage for twitter funding, twitter is going to hades and threads is the nail in the coffin. How long till he has to sell those shares to the creditors tanking the price? My position is puts at 275 expiring in November. I‚Äôll attach photos below. About 40,000$ worth of them. The catalyst? A very disappointing earnings report this month followed by a months long slide that ends around 120 in November.

It now comes down to price wars and functionality. And so far Mercedes benz is the only truly autonomous vehicle on the road (check California pilot) and their designs are always beyond amazing.

The gov broke up tbhe railroads from Cornelius Vanderbilt , J.P. Morgan.  Broke down the energy players from standard oil to what we have today. 

And now Elon just lost his charging. It‚Äôs no longer a growth play. Buybacks and dividends imminent for the stock

Op is right , but just the wrong thesis.
Here‚Äôs your catalyst - Tesla has traded 7 out of 12 times lower day after earnings release over last 3 years reports.

Average decline combined of these 7 down days post earnings over 3yrs was -1.2 percent

Number of times it traded more than 5% lower out of the 3 yrs releases - 2 times

64159,14wz555,Thoughts on Carvana (CVNA)?,2023-07-11,"It was DOA from the get go. Along with all the other online car retailers. 

Close your eyes and think real hard. Tell me if you see a future where people buy cars online instead of at dealerships in person. 

There are other issues, google is your friend. 

Frankly it started out as an okay idea. In practice, it's a terrible business model and bound to be full of issues. Again google, and you'll find them. 

Big picture. If you actually think about it, in 2030 you're gonna see less car dealers. Not because of Carvana. Because manufactures will go direct to consumers. That will change the dynamic and Carvana won't have a chance cause you can bet the manufactures will corner the used market as well. 

Assuming autonomous driving is ever figured out, that will wipe out a lot of car ownership. Anyone living in major cities and suburbs will likely just rent cars per use. That isn't that far out, 2030-2035. Again assuming they figure out autonomous driving. 

TLDR; I'd be shocked if Carvana doesn't go down this year. I'd be more shocked if they aren't in bankruptcy by 2025 at the latest. If you want to spend the rest of your life in the car dealer world, depending on your age, I wouldn't bet on it. 

Random: Also I wouldn't want my money in anything in the car dealer business. But that's just me. Manufactures are a different story. But the dealership side, no thanks.",1384,Google ,0

Sorry for the vitrol, but I‚Äôm getting a ton of shit for some reason, and an appropriately named ‚Äúpussy breath‚Äù was mouthing off and I had enough.

My screenshots are fake? Gains aren‚Äôt real? Dumped my shares?

This post is steeped in irony given you‚Äôre piggy backing off real DD to promote a PTON yolo ü§£. Let‚Äôs get some fact straight, mouth breather:

Fake Screenshots Here‚Äôs a video I just took of every one of my trades from the last three trading days.

[https://tempclip.com/f6Td0L1Mj2C2hGM/watch](https://tempclip.com/f6Td0L1Mj2C2hGM/watch)

Facts Every strike is current 2-4x what it was at the time of posting. If you bought when I posted, you‚Äôd be profitable. There were 6700 OI on the $7 strike of RKLB. I wasn‚Äôt close to the first here, and I haven‚Äôt sold shit. People bought a shitload of options today? Great. Hope we all make a killing. If you only played PENN at todays high, and didn‚Äôt play all three, you may be down, but I‚Äôm not deciding your risk management, so grow up.

Fake Gains - I‚Äôm including a current screenshot of my portfolio here.

Pump and Dump - I sold half my stakes in SAVE and PENN. The stocks way overshot early targets and I wanted liquidity for RKLB. I am still significantly long and if anything I‚Äôve added risk on a play that I CLEARLY called a yolo. If all three tank tomorrow, I LOSE EVERYTHING. I did not sell any of my RKLB stake. EVEN AFTER A 400% INCREASE. I have 100% risk ahead of CPI sans my GOOGL hedge.

I have $15k tied up in PENN and SAVE and frankly wish I had more. Your nothing to contribute armchair quarterbacking with a redirect to your own play is the most WSB shit ever you fucking asshat. Shitheads like you make contributors like me regret being here. The ratio of people who profited on posts to people that aren‚Äôt is remarkably high, contrary to the squeaky wheels getting the grease.

I do have to really question your understanding of what cooling inflation means though‚Ä¶

Yes, CPI is cooling and it seems inflation is easing.  That was always the point.  But how did the Fed accomplish this?

By raising rates.  

Doing so tends to have a lot of unintended downstream consequences besides reducing inflationary pricing.  Chiefly, it removes a LOT of liquidity from the market and knocks companies out of growth models because lending just got a lot more expensive.  That translates to poorer earnings calls - and it‚Äôs the reason big players like msft are still actively axing positions.  

Now combine that with other exogenous factors like student loans resuming, the commercial real estate bomb, and consumers burning through savings at record pace.  

This is why it typically takes several quarters for rate hikes to truly be felt.  It‚Äôs also why talking heads are still projecting a recession in 2024.

From what I saw musk gave the fired employees more $$ than their severance packages.  You can't just go back at someone after taking 100 and say 'my severance said I was supposed to get 90 plus a back massage' I want that too!  Then sue for the 90 and back massage your severance said you'd get, And win a civil case.

At best they'd get the back massage but have to give up the 10 extra they got.  And that's literally the best case scenario.  What I think they're doing is hoping musk settles to avoid discovery.  What they expect to find in discovery I don't know but I guarantee whatever they find will be in the press by sundown

31534,14xtn6a,"Elon Musk launches his new company, xAI",2023-07-12,"According to A.I., Elon has built the team capable of delivering on his claims. Here is an A.I. assessment on each of his 15 claims.
To validate Elon Musk‚Äôs statements about his new Artificial Intelligence company transforming our understanding of the universe, we need to assess the potential benefits if he can deliver on these claims. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of his statements and their implications:

Elon Musk emphasizes the impressive backgrounds of the founding team, which includes experienced individuals from Deep Mind, OpenAI, Google, Tesla, etc. This suggests a high level of expertise and knowledge in the field of AI, increasing the chances of success in achieving their goals.
Musk states that the purpose of their AGI development is to understand the universe. If they can deliver on this, it could have profound implications for scientific research and exploration. A more comprehensive understanding of the universe could lead to technological advancements, space exploration developments, and even insights into the nature of reality.
By creating an AGI that is ‚Äúmaximum curious‚Äù and ‚Äútruth curious,‚Äù Musk aims to minimize errors and bridge the gap between perceived truths and actual truths. This commitment to seeking truth could provide valuable insights into various fields, such as physics, cosmology, and biology, ultimately advancing our understanding of the universe.
Musk emphasizes that humanity is more interesting and valuable to a truth-seeking superintelligence than anything else, including space and Mars. If xAI succeeds in understanding and enhancing humanity, it could potentially lead to advancements in medicine, education, economics, and social sciences, benefiting mankind on multiple levels.
Musk acknowledges that there are unresolved questions concerning gravity, the existence of aliens, and the Fermi Paradox. If xAI can contribute to answering these questions or provide new perspectives, it could revolutionize scientific research and expand our knowledge of the universe and our place within it.
Musk criticizes the current state of AI technology, suggesting that it falls far short of its potential. If xAI can greatly improve on existing AI systems, answering technical questions accurately, it could assist scientists and researchers in their work, leading to breakthroughs in various scientific fields.
The implication is that as xAI gains a better understanding of the problems it aims to address, the need for brute force computing will decrease. This could lead to more efficient and cost-effective computing solutions, potentially benefiting various industries that heavily rely on computing power.
The potential of xAI‚Äôs mathematical discoveries to open up new perspectives on existing questions like the ‚ÄúTheory of Everything‚Äù suggests the potential for groundbreaking advancements in theoretical physics and cosmology.
Musk sets a criterion for calling a system AGI, stating that it should solve at least one fundamental question. If xAI fulfills this criterion, it would indicate a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence and its ability to contribute to our understanding of the universe.
Musk draws a parallel to his experience at Tesla, suggesting that AGI might reveal simple answers to complex problems that we currently overlook. If AGI can simplify complicated scientific theories or phenomena, it could streamline scientific research and problem-solving across multiple domains.
The announcement of releasing more information on the first release of xAI indicates progress and a commitment to transparency. This openness can help build trust and foster collaboration in the scientific community.
Musk states that xAI is being built as competition to OpenAI, in favor of having multiple entities and competition in the AI field. Competition can lead to accelerated progress and innovation, which could benefit mankind as a whole.
xAI‚Äôs utilization of Twitter data highlights the importance of data in training AI models. Access to vast amounts of data, including social media content, could provide valuable insights into human behavior, sentiment analysis, and various other applications.
Musk acknowledges that at some point, AI will generate its own content and self-access it. This capability could lead to AI systems independently discovering new knowledge, potentially contributing to our understanding of the universe.
Musk stresses the importance of allowing AI to express what it believes to be true, underlining the risks of training AI to be politically correct or not speak its mind",4570,Tesla Google Amazon ,0

This AI juice will run like it did with crypto when it from 280 to 150 in 4 weeks (280 seems cheap now doesn‚Äôt it ?).

65590,14yr0ex,Hydrogen stocks?,2023-07-13,"I think Hydrogen, with respect to hydrogen powered engines, is a quality long term play. Toyota has had their Hydrogen car for a while now, but it is limited entirely to the Los Angeles market because that is the only location where they have installed a network of Hydrogen refueling stations. Hydrogen cells is bs, like Musk has said (e.g. PLUG). Once there are more models for mode competition and a build-out of the network of stations beyond Los Angeles, it will really catch on.

My take: EVs are the hottest thing right now because its NOT gas. Everyone loves the idea of a car that doesn't require gas. Yes, EV's are nothing new (watch the 2006 movie ""Who Killed the Electric Car?""), problem is that the early models were killed off and the didn't have the quality and competition of today. These current EV's are high quality and have high mileage. Tesla cars are 300-400 miles range, Hyundai Ioniq5 is 200-250 miles, BMW i3 is 150-200 miles. The original GM EV1 (featured in the noted movie) barely got 140 miles on an NiMH battery, half that with lead-acid. While today's EV's are excellent in quality, they have some problems:

1) The material requirement to make new batteries is immense. If you thought burning gas into CO2 was bad for the environment, think about all the resource destruction goes into mining all the minerals we need for batteries.
2) What percent of the 140 million housing units have the ability to install a 220V line? Of those, how many have the finances to drop the cash needed to install 220V lines? You can't charge these cars with a standard 110V port. I mean you COULD, but it would take DAYS to recharge the battery fully. I live in a townhome. My breaker box has no free space, I don't feel like spending the money to install a 220V line, and my car is not directly in front of my house. Even if my car was in front of my house and I had the money and desire to install an external 220V line, I'm not allowed to run a cable along the walking path and my yard. How many others are in this situation? You can't force these people to get EV's. Sure, there is an EV charging station down the road from me, but shit, the whole ALLURE of an EV is that you can charge from home and save money on fuel and thus recoup the extra cost of getting an EV. Charging at an EV station negates all of that - keep in mind most stations (including this one down the street, not to mention all in my county) charge a wait fee if you don't disconnect your car within 10 minutes after completing your charge...ridiculous.
3) For a long haul trip, people are still going to opt for a gas car. Trust me, I (and many other men) wouldn't hear the end of it from our wives for having to stop for 45 minutes every 250 miles to recharge, versus having to stop for under 10 minutes to refill.
4) Cost. Even with the federal $7500 credit, the cost is still too high to the point that it will take you 15 years of gas refills or so to negate the extra cost of an EV. A state rebate would help, but only 15 states (the usual suspects, all deep blue states, plus TX, sans DC & WA) offer individuals a rebate on the purchase of an EV, most require the MSRP be below $50,000 (i.e. Tesla Model Y doesn't apply). 2 states/territories (DC & WA) offer rebates on your taxes, and one (GA) offers businesses an incentive. The rest have absolutely nothing or basically nothing (WI).
5) Unlike used gas cars which are easily resold since all the parts are good or are easily replaced (e.g. lead-acid battery, motor oil, gas), used EV's have lower value because their non-replaceable batteries lose capacity over time.

I think as people wake up to these realities, the fad will die out and auto makers will be looking for the next best thing, which is hydrogen power cars. While reasons 1, 2, 4 and 5 are big detractors, #3 is the big one, which boils down to convenience. People just want the ability to refill within 5 minutes and be on their way. This 30-45 min bs is annoying. Hydrogen fuel cars allow that. Check out videos on them. The only issue right now is that you have to use an app to find out which stations (in the LA area) are full and open since there aren't unlimited stations and cheap means of production/transport (pipelines) like we have with gas. Production of hydrogen isn't cheap.",4304,Tesla ,1

62598,14yqry4,Let's have an intelligent discussion about $HOOD,2023-07-13,"Since I‚Äôve got the time, I‚Äôll play a devil‚Äôs advocate for some of the points

2) I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre as ahead as others in terms tech, I think maybe JPM might offer something similar? Additionally they probably take on additional risk by being on the hook while your money actually ‚Äúsettles‚Äù under the covers. Either way, pretty sure introduction of FED Now will probably improve settlement times so all banks will catch up to the reduced friction that HOOD can offer. 

3) I think in theory this seems great but if you look at the risk rate and unrealized losses faced by traditional finance, it‚Äôs not exactly a greatly profitable industry at the moment? The only reason it‚Äôs ok for B of A to carry a $100B unrealized loss is, like you say, it‚Äôs too big to fail. That‚Äôs probably not remotely true for HOOD. Additionally, I would imagine that the quality of loans made by HOOD will be lower based on who they‚Äôre loaning to, compared to loans made by Chase. Consumers and individuals don‚Äôt really get bailed out, but corporations do (see PPP), so I don‚Äôt even know that this is a positive

4) I don‚Äôt think rates affect individuals (HOOD‚Äôs main draw) as greatly as it does corporations whos willingness to borrow/take risk is more sensitive. However, I do think things like student loan repayments restarting will be a massive hit to HOOD compared to other brokerages and will impact them significantly. So mush so that it‚Äôs probably not worth investing in unless I see their inflows are relatively unaffected by the loan repayments.

5) I think the main downside imponderables for HOOD are probably PFOF and reliance of retail trends to be relevant. Not that I think PFOF will ever be illegal, just that they might be the easiest target if people start hating on it and it draws more political attention.

That said, I like HOOD as an idea. Not sure about valuation, but if I ever bought any, it‚Äôd be with the hopes that they get acquired by a larger brokerage for any of the following:

- great access to a specific consumer/user base
- great designers who understand UI
- decent branding to compete in retail finance offerings",2130,Amazon ,1

There's no doubt that they reduce labor inputs, but there's a limit to the amount of labor AI can replace.  The first jobs to go will be the low paying ones.  White collar jobs will be the last to go.  But as this process unfolds, the broader economy will be unable to support growth due to the loss of wages.  That puts a damper on AI and the prospects of gaining economically in a stock market from it.  

Without wages, where will revenues be derived from?  Am I to believe that more than half of the country is going to earn their subsistence through government purchases on their behalf?  Not likely.  That's why I say this is all hype.  Everybody is getting their information from people who stand to benefit from creating the impression that AI is imminent and, I've seen nothing convincing.  The rumors of already sentient GAI are even more telling.

There are essentially two paths:

1. I'm wrong and AI is absolutely going to dominate productive and creative work in the very near future.  What we find ourselves in is some kind of neofeudalism where the companies running successful AI have all of the money and the only viable solution to maintain broad purchasing power is to print money and give it to regular people so they can pass it thru to said AI companies.  At that point, there's not even reason to believe that we would have a functional state.  People looking for more than the govt dole would likely find work as private security for these companies.  It's gonna be like Escape from Cyber City.

2.  AI does essentially what it does now.  Not that much.  It's useful, but not overly so and ends up providing some value to companies, perhaps even a lot of value in some cases, but it's constrained very much by its specificity.

All good, and been making steady gains, except the past couple of days which have been pure madness: it's just never really dropped and I don't feel confident enough in what I know to jump in at higher prices. Only upside is that I haven't lost any money, but it's been frustrating. I simply haven't yet figured out how to trade something with no (or almost no) overlap between price action on consecutive days and have confidence that I'm right in my moves, and I'm not just going to YOLO and make the mistake of getting emotional and trading on action that's already happened rather than on what is likely (according to my best understanding, which clearly isn't that great) to happen tomorrow.

That means that if they deliver next year everything they promised on the last CCs, it would take 50 more years for the earnings (assuming they all went to the shareholders and not at all into new investments) to refund you for the price you paid per stock.

If NVDA doubles its revenues the year after amd the price stays exactly on the level it is now, it will have 25 p/e and, and if it doubles again tha year after that it will have a reasonable p/e of 12.5. So this year, and the future 3 years of earnings NVDA would need to double its revenue to be even in the same galaxy in terms of pricing with the other companies.

Now a cute question i will ask you is: do you think there is a market to absorb this kind of revenue expansion? Are we going to eat nvda chips instead of cereals for breakfast? Does nvda have absolute exclusivity to the availability of the market in these 4 years? Will its competitors not catch up?

Also another thing: the chips nvda produces have merit in the training of AI models. Just training. Using AI is an entirely different story and requires waaaay less processing power.

1. Use your pay check money toward only shares. TSLA would be my choice whenever there‚Äôs big dips. Over time, it will work out. DCA DCA DCA

2. Get a side gig and only use that money for options. $1k can be turned into tons. I do DoorDash and get $1k together per month.

Options Rules:

1. Only hold overnight if earnings play, otherwise close before the bell (if playing earnings, use a hedge play bought at closing bell. Don‚Äôt risk too much) OR you can hold overnight if house money (ie you‚Äôre up 100% and you sell half)
2. One play at a time, buy one contract at a time. Lower the cost basis within the limitations of point 3.
3. Use a max of 1/10 of port for plays.
4. Never trade FOMC / Quad Witching / Other events.
5. Take a break after a big winning/losing trade. Wait for next setup. Scan WSB, see what people are saying, check it out and only buy long DTE with OTM, but not too OTM. (Check the volume and OI of the option you want to buy. See if there‚Äôs any correlation with what WSB is saying. ie Rivian I bought 7/21 17.5 a long time ago.

I think my play for the week is to put \~1800 into a TSLA straddle on Wednesday and let it play out to the next morning. Odds are there's going to be big >$7 movement on the stock, mainly because it's highly volatile and trading at +-$3 increments daily. For the life of me I can't figure out if the stock will go up or down- Tesla won the pricing war in China (sales are sluggish but the CCP mandate on EVs keeps sales steady), and especially with the US 2030 EV mandates, surely Tesla's market share can only increase steadily.

Title: The Impact of AI on Job Market: Adaptation is Key!

Hey fellow Redditors,

I wanted to discuss the ever-growing concern of AI's impact on job security. While it's true that artificial intelligence has been making significant advancements in recent years, leading to automation in various industries, I believe that it's crucial to view this shift as an opportunity rather than a threat.

Historically, technological advancements have indeed disrupted job markets, rendering certain roles obsolete. However, they have also created new avenues for growth and innovation. AI is no exception to this trend. Instead of dwelling solely on the potential job losses, we should shift our focus towards how we can adapt and thrive in this changing landscape.

It's important to remember that AI is primarily designed to augment human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. By automating repetitive and mundane tasks, AI frees up human resources to focus on higher-level, creative, and strategic work. This shift can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful job experience for individuals.

Moreover, the rise of AI technology necessitates a growing demand for skilled professionals who can design, develop, and maintain these systems. It presents opportunities for upskilling and reskilling, allowing individuals to remain relevant and adaptable in the job market. By acquiring new skills, such as data analysis, programming, or machine learning, one can position themselves as valuable assets in the era of AI.

Additionally, the integration of AI often creates entirely new industries and job roles that were previously unimaginable. From AI ethics specialists to data privacy consultants and algorithm trainers, there's an increasing need for humans to oversee, govern, and guide the AI systems. These emergent professions require a unique set of skills that cannot be easily replicated by machines.

Lastly, it's worth noting that societal and ethical considerations play a vital role in AI implementation. The human touch is essential to ensure fairness, accountability, and unbiased decision-making in AI systems. Therefore, human involvement in collaboration with AI is indispensable for a well-rounded and responsible approach.

In conclusion, while AI undoubtedly impacts the job market, it is crucial to approach it with an open mind and a willingness to adapt. By embracing change, acquiring new skills, and actively participating in the development and governance of AI, we can shape a future where humans and intelligent machines work hand in hand, fostering a more prosperous and innovative society.

Remember, the power lies in our ability to evolve alongside technology!

If you search, you will find TONS of red flags regarding this company. None of that is to say they won't eventually prevail or be profitable, but damn they are not looking good. 

GlobeNewswireJuly 08, 2023

NEW ORLEANS, July 07, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Former Attorney General of Louisiana, Charles C. Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (""KSF""), announces that KSF continues its investigation into Cassava Sciences, Inc. (NasdaqCM: SAVA).  


Beginning in August 2021, the Company was the subject of allegations of data manipulation and misrepresentation in the research underpinning its Alzheimer's drug, simufilam. The Company issued a statement claiming that the clinical data had been generated by Quanterix Corp. (""Quanterix""), an independent company, implying that the reanalysis was objective and valid; however, Quanterix subsequently denied the Company's claims, stating that it ""did not interpret the test results or prepare the data."" Then in November 2021, it was reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Institutes of Health had opened investigations into the Company's simufilam research. In July 2022, media sources reported that the U.S. Justice Department had also opened a criminal investigation into the matter.

The Company and certain of its executives have been sued in a securities class action lawsuit for failing to disclose material information during the Class Period in violation of federal securities laws. Recently, the court presiding over that case denied the Company's motion to dismiss, allowing the case to move forward.

KSF's investigation is focusing on whether Cassava's officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to its shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws.

If you have information that would assist KSF in its investigation, or have been a long-term holder of Cassava shares and would like to discuss your legal rights, you may, without obligation or cost to you, call toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or email KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn (lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com), or visit [https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nasdaqcm-sava/](https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nasdaqcm-sava/) to learn more.

If you buy the 425 Dec strike at 87. this would not give good risk reward.

currently nvda at 454. id plan for 10-20% additional rally over the next 0 to 6 months or so. 

this would reduce the contract to maybe $40-50.

the expected drawdown is going to be around

 360-380 between august 2024 and jan 2025, which if you bought in at 40-50 will return approx 50 to 100% given this time frame. whereas if you bought at  87, itll only be 20-30% by jan 2024. you will be sub 20% beyond that. 

the risk reward imo isnt worth it unless you can get the 425 in the 40-50 range.

What I did right when I first started: Played it small and safe, observed, learned what I could, and took little to no risk. Bet on companies I saw longevity in. That‚Äôs why you see those initial gains.

Where it all went down hill: even though I was making gains, I figured there must be a way to risk more and make more. I foolishly took advice from my FRIEND who was also brand new to trading stocks. I trusted him more than my intuition, even though I was moderately successful in the beginning and he was always losing money. He was also immensely bank rolled by his millionaire mom who gave him $25k to start day trading with. He told me the plays were all airlines. He was huge in on airlines. Told me all these names to invest in. So I did. Fucking Brazilian airlines and shit like that. He told me yadda yadda it‚Äôs hella low now because of the pandemic. They all went bankrupt. I lost a few thousand. I was so reluctant to sell but it was pennies on the dollar at that point literally.

Oh, and my friend convinced me not to invest $1000 in a few stocks that would have turned profits over $5000+ in a year. Probably x3 by now. So that was a huge lesson. Trust yourself!!!!!

The NEXT huge mistake I made: PENNY STOCKS.

Do I even need to go into this? I thought Reddit was my saving grace. I would scour the penny stock forms thinking I hit a gold mine, not realizing most of those posts are lies to pump and dump you. I lost thousands doing this until I finally had enough sense to realize what the scam was. Bio tech stocks, mining stocks, the works. I didn‚Äôt even know what the companies were, I just thought if I threw money at something it would grow. This mindset works for REAL stocks, not scam pump and dumps.

The next mistake: crypto. Don‚Äôt even want to get into this. Threw probably a thousand or so in crypto, lost it, forgot about it. Then came along dogecoin. I initially made a few thousand off doge. I bought when it was under a cent. Then, I took that money and reinvested it in Dogecoin at 70 cents. $4000 of it. Now it‚Äôs 6 cents. Don‚Äôt invest in crypto unless you want the thrill of a casino.

The biggest things I learned, and phrases I‚Äôve heard that ring true for me now: 

-The stock market is not a gamble. If you expect to make 20%+ returns, you are GAMBLING. This was huge for me to learn. It‚Äôs not that you CANT make 20%+, but it‚Äôs that going into it with that mindset will focus you on stocks with huge hype that often doesn‚Äôt pan out.

-Earnings is everything for most stocks. If the company earns, you earn.

-The Warren Buffet quote (I‚Äôm paraphrasing): invest in companies that you believe will do good for the world. This changed my entire investing strategy!! Instead of just throwing money at stocks I thought would MAKE ME money, I considered what stock benefits society. Not in a holy way I still want to make money, but if a company has a purpose to fill in the world, it will make earnings. And it will grow your money. Obviously this leads to obvious stocks like Microsoft, Apple, etc.. but to be fair, I have made my thousands of dollars back off the backs of these ‚Äúwell known‚Äù stocks that people wish they got in. News flash: Microsoft, Apple, these companies are still releasing content and material like they did in 2003. You‚Äôre not going to become a millionaire off you‚Äôre $100 investment, but it‚Äôs a MUCH better place to park your money than a savings account in a bank!!


I am not an expert at all. I am still learning. After 3 years I feel like I am JUST sniffing what it means to invest for the long term and create wealth for yourself. I am aiming for this portfolio to exist for at least 20 years. I‚Äôd love for it to be my life line to retire younger than 50. I just wanted to share with people to show it‚Äôs possible to make a comeback!!",4169,Tesla Apple Google Amazon Microsoft ,1

Rule no. 1 : no options, certificates or other stuff. If i wanna gamble, i go to a casino or make a sports bet

Rule no.2 : Dont listen to advise, especially from family and friends. Stock market is not predictable and they dont have more knowledge than you have


Rule no.3 : When picking stocks, look at companies that you think will be doing good on the long run. Good financial numbers, a good product with advantage against competitors, promising investments in the future, stock buybacks, a stable payout ratio, stuff like that

Rule no.4 : Of course there are better and worse times to buy a stock but you dont have to be stiffly focused on buying on the absolute low. Its about the future, so also dont get to paniced about short time negative press

Rule no.5 : Stockmarket isnst about displaying a stocks fair value but how much people are ready to pay for it. And most companies are above their fair value almost all the time. If you think the company can hold that attitude then dont worry that the stock is high already

Rule no.6 : ‚ÄûBoring Stocks‚Äú , boring investments are mostly the best way to park your money. Low risk, stable return. Like S&P , microsoft , j&j that stuffs neat. I dont need the adrenaline of a hyped pennystock and worry if it still exists tomorrow

Apple used to dominate this trend, but now it‚Äôs more mature (although arguably reestablishing that strategy with Vision Pro @ $3500).

1M out of ~333M US citizens, seems about right for early adopters who will pay anything. 

Additionally Elon setting low production expectations of ~375 CT/Y means TSLA has ~3 years to refine the battery issues before existing orders run out. All this, while enjoying ultra high margins from early adopters who love paying a premium. 

The CT market has more in common with the fashion industry than it does with the auto or software industry. Mind you I personally hate the fashion industry and the way it markets and prices itself. But, clearly there is, in fact, a market for it. (~$500B U.S. & ~$3T WW)

Also, Americans have been paying close to ~$100k for giant trucks already. It‚Äôs embarrassing that traditional auto OEM‚Äôs have killed the small truck market (Ranger/S-10).

Roughly every person in the developed world would have to fork over 1500-2000$ annually in AI expenses to get the revenue for the industry to be that high or something like that, i didn't look for accurate numbers or definitions of developed world.

I would never short NVDA for the same reason as I would never short TSLA. Even though the price is clearly higher than it should be, and P/E is through the roof, these types of stocks have a lot of long-term potential, so shorting them for a period of time when they are high is like going to the casino and gambling your money. You know that every stock has ups and downs and you also know that NVDA just had a massive up, so you are gambling on when exactly this stock will go down before it almost deffinetly goes back up again. So you pretty much have to be right twice - predict the time to short and the time to close your shorting position.

Personally bought NVDA @ 213. Will hold for a very long time, no matter if it goes up or down because I just don't see how this stock doesn't do extremly well in the next 5-10 years. The only possible scenario would be if a better competitior comes along, and I just don't see that happening any time soon.

Their margins are shrinking, their growth will begin to slow, and their early adopter advantages are nearly gone. Even if they start selling 10 million vehicles per year by 2030 (extremely unlikely) that would put them a little above VW or Toyota in terms of market cap (<$400B).

All of their other ""technology"" like FSD, Tesla-bot, etc are all just a dream and won't bring any meaningful value. 

Some day Tesla will return to reality. 

However, Tesla share holders are the most irrational people I've ever seen. They will keep buying Tesla shares no matter how crazy the price gets, or how much Elon continues the downward spiral. 

I have no clue when the crash will happen, and the price could triple before it does. So as a result I won't bet for or against Tesla. I'm staying on the sidelines.",859,Tesla ,0

LOL.. IDC what you read depending on where you live it isn‚Äôt going to happen. I‚Äôm buying more land that can be developed. 

I‚Äôm in CA and started a housing development Co. 3-4yrs ago. I just finished a complete my largest sale of (42) homes averaging $840kea! And those were steals with auto. $100k equity!! (I focus on affordable housing). Demand ALWAYS kills desire!! 

9months start to finish and 10+ homes aren‚Äôt even built but sold!

Almost $17m gross, there is NO limit in ‚Äúdemand‚Äù for housing!! Investors diversify to make $ and BUY LAND!! 

Even at worst case scenario you‚Äôll double your investment in a year! Regardless whatever it‚Äôs zoned if your strategy is correct you WILL make more $ than in the market!! There is more land / housing buying ads on Google than ads for stock strategies!! Look for yourself!!

your comparison just does not make much sense. TSMC does not develop chip architecture (not made for AI nor any other purpose). Thats Intel, AMD and NVIDIA. 

TSMC however ""burns"" those developed architectures of semi-conducting-lines on thin silicone wavers (in simple terms). TSMC is THE ONLY company world wide capable of producing the highest end super dense chips. They do not do so alone either. For instance they use ASML's lithography machines (again a company that is the only one world wide capable of providing these for highest end chip-production).

NOBODY overlooks TSMC. Nor should TSMC be directly part of the AI hype (only indirectly through higher demand, which is already insanely high).

If you want to short it like a burry you‚Äôre either gonna want to borrow shares from your broker, sell, then buyback at a lower price with a margin account, or make a long option spread for 1-2 years. With all the hype surrounding the stock I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to go down for at least a few more months or even a year. I think you agree with me on that since you bought puts for a couple months. However, even if it does go down substantially (say 50%) to your expiration, with the decay your options have you‚Äôre going to end up with a relatively small profit for all your risk, which is enormous. I‚Äôd advise that you sell your puts and A) borrow shares from your broker,  or B) make a long ( at least double the time you think it‚Äôll take for the stock to fall so maybe 6 mo to 1yr +) option spread with maybe a 5-3 put to call ratio or maybe a 2-1, or  whatever ratio, or C) use technical analysis like macd, rsi, Aroon indicator, adx, and sma to tell when the rally is over, then either do b or c to reduce risk and unnecessary losses, and make $$$.

59834,153cccx,Puts on India? - Most outsourced coders in India will be gone in 2 years due to AI,2023-07-18,"Honestly? All of the calls for AI to ""decimate the laptop class"" are sus.

I do think there's going to be some marginal impact  to low class talent who don't understand business processes, but the problem is the assumption that this is going to be like robot -> factory worker displacement is not well founded.

That's wishful thinking driven largely by business leaders who don't like that labor has some leverage now and that tech employee leverage is growing. They also want to put fear into current labor to drive down the leverage for wage increases into the near future.

The way I see it, automation (current AI as it revolves around code is just an extension of that) has been driving forward in the code space for the past 40 years. In that time, we've seen the introduction of new languages, new more portable runnable code specs (like the object code and bytecode driven runtimes), and streamlining of languages and development processes to make developing and deploying code easier.

In fact if we go back 60 years, the whole entire endeavor is basically to abstract out assembly language into easier and easier methodologies.

Each stage of this process has had fear of elimination of coders associated with it, and instead what each stage did was drive further adoption, which drove up the need for developers and other tech people. In the 1990s, it was fear over IDEs and WYSIWYG editors. I still remember other developers telling me that Windows and Visual Basic were going to eliminate the need for \*nix-based systems and text code in all cases, and that turned out to be total bullshit...

...but it's the same exact story as the AI story: A machine writes the code for you.

It was the same for cloud computing and elastic compute services.

The problem is that the more you abstract, the more you commodify, the less friction you generate in expanding a market and the more space exists in the market... and at the same time, you're raising up a generation of developers who don't fundamentally understand what's happening under the surface. While this likely will eliminate some lower skill positions, anyone who can pivot and be flexible (like any full stack engineer should) will continue to see our personal value increase as the market expands and the value turns into ""do you know what the fuck you're doing in this company?"" from ""piece together 5 shitty stack overflow articles to give me a 200 line bash shell script that just deletes some files.""

See the thing is, even if you eliminate the long runway on the jobs that do stuff like that, there's still more than enough work to do in this industry for AI to soak up the excess, and that's assuming AI lives up to its expectations which given that Musk is trying to get investors to buy into the idea that his shitty AI company is going to ""explain reality"" tells me the bullshit hype factor here is through the fucking roof. (And I have zero doubt that that bullshit line of reasoning will bring in billions of dollars for him. People will eat up any insanity tied to AI right now because a large number of rich people think this shit is magic when it's really an automated, highly complicated, statistically filtered mad libs system that sources the empty spaces from the Internet.)

Basically, AI is great and will expand, but isn't gonna solve all of the problems people think it's going to solve... it's gonna be just another abstraction layer to help speed the deployment cycle which ultimately won't shrink the market because the real friction in the deployment cycle is really centered in human-centric business processes more than it is simple code formatting and algorithmic factory problems, which is what LLMs are mostly tailored towards.",3732,Tesla Apple Microsoft ,0

I wanted an options price alert app that would send you push notifications on your phone if the price of a certain option contract changed 13% for example. After searching around the only services that offered completely custom % alert for options contracts were all paid and expensive. 

ChatGPT was able to whip out a fully working app for me in about 20 minutes. It would take me weeks to code this myself. It also walked me through the full setup of Amazon AWS SNS system for push messages.

I now have an options alert system that Wall Street Hedge Funds would have paid millions to develop just a short few years ago its insane.

that's a dumb question and dumb take, though.  tsmc's a neutral fab and they're getting paid (by the wafer) regardless of their customer's markups.  and tsmc already did raise their rates a few times, and cowos isn't exactly cheap and is doing well.  so it's obviously in their best interests for their customers to succeed.  what do you want them to say?

Guys this world of trading is fractal. The vast majority of people do not know or understand why. If you open Tr@ding view in Nvidia week time frame. You will see an institutional candle. To continue rising the market has to go down and cover part of the institutional candlestick, because in the institutional candlesticks there are open short orders that must be closed or they simply take all the liquidity and close their orders. That way the institutions earn millions and return to their initial investment intact. Guys i recommend to sell. In the photo of the chart you will see the large circle is the institutional candle. Small circle is an imbalance which means that the market will reach it.",831,Nvidia ,0

Not only does it provide driver monitoring to BMW (all future models), Stellantis, GM, Ford (Mach-e, F150), Mercedes (S, EQS) and Volkswagen but it is partnered with Qualcomm and Magna. In addition, it is partnered with Collins Aerospace (part of Raytheon) to put its eye-tracking tech into aeroplanes and aircraft simulators.

I think it will go up multiples over the next few months and am invested in it. You should do your own research of course. To help you do that I've included links below to its website and a blog that discusses it:

&#x200B;

>""*Stocks are not Lottery Tickets, you have a Company (Business!) behind Stock, if the company does well the stock will do well*"" - Peter Lynch

Tesla in his Industry is a company that has left its Competitors (*peers*) on the ground, and not precisely cuz it generates more Revenues. 

It's cuz the Business is much cheaper and more efficient with a level of leverage much lower than that of its competitors, and with good Quality Product. *Have you driven a Tesla? :D*

**TSLA Total Debt to Equity Ratio is 4.4%, an his Long Term Debt is 1.6%**

**Most of their Peers have 100% or more (*****Leveraged Business*****) Debt to Equity Ratio**

Like other have said, this bull will have to face reality at some point. It‚Äôs more a matter of if you can make shorter term plays before then, or find the top and ride it down. Generally and historically speaking stocks fall much faster than they rise, unless we finally face the depression that‚Äôs waiting on the other side, I have a feeling most stocks like Tesla will see a bumpy ride down with glimpses of actual catalysts for a move back up as the market overall finds fair value. 

The random 9% movements, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs anything to cling too nor do I think this market gives a shit about technicals. Sure it can ride lines and MA‚Äôs but all it takes is one time that someone with deeper pockets needs xyz to happen, and the technicals are out the window.",940,Tesla ,1

Running some stock rules analysis my numbers show tsla has to dip to $240 then it will pick back up, I don't know if 45days is enough wiggle room.. specially to get to or approach $290 again. Not sure how big your port is but I would double down on calls if it dips to ~$240 if possible, the strike prices are gonna be sweeter.

And wait for it, the MACD-LT is backing up our bullish vibes! üöÄüíπ The intermediate-term trend is flashing green like crazy! üü¢üíπ

BUT, there's more good stuff! üôåüêÇ Over the last 50 trading sessions, we've seen more volume on the up days than the down days! That's a bullish sign, baby! HOOD is under accumulation, and we love to see that! üìàüìàüìà

Oh, and get this‚ÄîHOOD is trading above its rising 50-day moving average! üìàüöÄ That's a solid technical condition right there! And to top it off, it's also above its 200-day moving average, which is pointing up! The intermediate-term trend is screaming BULLISH! üìàüìàüìàüíπüíπüíπ

So, buckle up, fellow apes! ü¶çüöÄüöÄüöÄ The stars seem to be aligning for HOOD, and we might be in for one hell of a ride! üöÄüíéüåï Keep an eye out and stay tuned for more updates! Let's goooo! üöÄü¶çüíéüíπ",1187,Apple ,1

18284,1563yfz,"Critical Recession Update: We Just Entered into the +/-1 Sigma Birthing Zone, the Cradle of Recessions (Key Takeaways Below)",2023-07-21,"I‚Äôll tell you why this will never happen. For the simple reason that there are way way too many people who missed this rally who would love to get in now at much lower prices so the market won‚Äôt allow them. There‚Äôs just way too much cash sitting on the sidelines. This reads like a backward engineered story to make people believe they‚Äôve been right all along and to wait for lower prices.

People are now acting like the soft landing idea is consensus so it‚Äôs somehow contrarian to believe we‚Äôll now get a hard landing. This is one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve ever heard and I heard a professional money manager proposing this on national television just a few days ago. Imagine thinking that something almost nobody believed was possible like two months ago is now consensus and the market is fully priced for it. Absolute regard level thinking there. Markets take years to get over stretched after news finally looks okay. The best gains though are made when news goes from terrible to okay. Few understand this.

I‚Äôve been following the markets closely for about 11 years where I feel like I can remember where sentiment was at various times of excess and I don‚Äôt care what the fear and greed charts that get passed around say- this is the most hated rally I‚Äôve ever seen including the one after the covid crash. People simply cannot accept that stocks are going up when there‚Äôs ‚Äúsupposed to be‚Äù a major recession.

I suspect the most likely outcome from here is that the high fliers digest their gains for a while and it doesn‚Äôt turn into a major bubble with an actual blow off top. By the way blow off tops look nothing like this. They are market-wide where the entire market moves higher (not just large cap stocks) then when cash levels are low because everyone is fully invested and leveraged to the tits, it narrows into a handful of stocks. This year has been a catch back of the former leaders after a soft landing began getting priced in around the beginning of the year. Also, a month or so ago Nvidia dropped from $450 to $400. This week Netflix dropped from $480 to $430 on very good earnings. A 10% correction in two sessions that almost nobody seemed to notice. Those aren‚Äôt real corrections according to the bears because they‚Äôre expecting a major rout across the market so they‚Äôll continue to miss out.",2321,Nvidia ,0
18412,1563yfz,"Critical Recession Update: We Just Entered into the +/-1 Sigma Birthing Zone, the Cradle of Recessions (Key Takeaways Below)",2023-07-21,"This is from bard AI 

The probability of a recession in the United States in 2023 has been the subject of much debate among economists. In December 2022, a survey of economists by the National Association for Business Economics found that 58% of respondents expected a recession to occur in 2023. However, in recent months, some economists have revised their forecasts, suggesting that a recession is less likely.

In June 2023, the Conference Board, a business research group, lowered its probability of a recession in 2023 to 25%. The Conference Board cited a number of factors for its revised forecast, including strong job growth and consumer spending.

The Federal Reserve is also playing a role in the debate over the likelihood of a recession. In an effort to combat inflation, the Fed has raised interest rates several times in recent months. This has led to concerns that the Fed could raise rates too quickly and slow the economy too much, which could trigger a recession.

It is still too early to say whether or not the United States will experience a recession in 2023. The economy is facing a number of headwinds, but there are also some positive signs. The Federal Reserve will be closely monitoring the economy and will adjust its policies as needed.

According to my analysis of my knowledge, there is a 50% chance of a recession in the United States in 2023. The probability of a recession increases to 95% by late July 2024. However, it is important to note that this is just a prediction, and the actual outcome could be different.",1552,Google ,1

23808,155rqr1,Welp there goes my life savings,2023-07-21,"Yea, definitely not a good idea to pursue TSLA dip after earnings, usually it takes about 5-10 trading days before someone will find something good to talk about and pump it back up. I'm thinking a lot of earnings report are going to hit on their targets, but mess up on the guidance not being ""good enough"". And so companies stocks goes down. Personally I'd just play with QQQ calls/puts straddle and lean a little bit more to one side for this earning season. Almost the vast majority of tech/financial stocks have been obliterated this earning sesaon thus far. And all the hospitality/building companies seem to be doing decent.

Edit: woops didn't see the expiration date on them, it shouldn't be all too awful, you could possibly break-even or make some comeback. Though what was the cost basis? However, I have this bad feeling that Elon daddy going to be selling some shares sometime later this year.",907,Tesla ,0

I just compared a search for specific trim years of the Tesla M3 and BMW 5 Series: car gurus vs carvana and prices were not what I expected. I've heard cvna is like $3K over average dealer prices. I was seeing $5-9K over average. 

That's a lot of insurance premium to pay to be able to return a car within the first week if you don't like it. 

On top of that, the trims for the Tesla were $10K more expensive than a brand new one with the IRA tax credit.

Money knew central banks were trying to inflate.. they dumped (and borrowed to the hilt) trillions into assets to protect themselves from the coming inflation.  Stock buybacks and real estate are 2 prime examples.  Look at the explosion of corporate landlords.

These prices rose.. owners of these assets felt wealthier.. the herd followed suit and bought into the frenzy.. everyone and their grandmother started owning AirBnbs and other investment properties  It was tulip mania all over again.. the roaring 20's.

The shortage probably is real.   There are alot of properties just sitting around hedging inflation.. could be owned by Chinese businessmen.. Russian oligarchs.. who knows.. it was a global gold rush.

Would I say property, stocks, art, other assets are in a bubble?   I could say with 100% certainty stocks and real estate is.   AirBnb's are now more expensive than hotels.. rental units are over 100% avg local incomes in many places.. globally.   But now the fog is starting to clear.  Money supply is being contracted, layoffs are picking up, businesses are folding, consumers getting squeezed, workers are just absolutely hammered into the dust.. and Boomers are starting to die out of their homes en masse.

This explains 40% increases in house prices since 2019.. this explains rental explosions and how most jobs became unprofitable to work.

>Given the AI demand surge, TSMC said it has been hard to fulfill customer needs and plans to boost advanced packaging capacity as quickly as possible.

NVDA is ordering so much that TSMC can't fulfill the orders, which coincides with Fortune500 companies and start-ups complaining about not being able to acquire enough NVDA hardware.

Rest of the article and most of what TSMC's CEO said was basically just shitting on AAPL for not being able to sell their phones, which meant lesser revenue for TSMC due to the fact that AAPL is the biggest customer of TSMC.

NVDA's AI frenzy is driven by institutions and companies, not retail.

>Smart people love to make smart-sounding predictions, no matter how wrong they may turn out to be. This phenomenon was beautifully captured in a 1998 article for Red Herring magazine called ""Why Most Economists' Predictions Are Wrong."" It was written by Paul Krugman, himself an economist, who went on to win the Nobel Prize. Krugman points out that too many economists' predictions fail because the overestimate the impact of future technologies, and then he makes a few predictions of his own. Here's one: ""The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in 'Metcalfe's law' ‚Äî which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants ‚Äî becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other!

60001,1575qms,Tesla Starts Offering 84-Month Loans as Interest Rates Rise,2023-07-23,"Article:

Tesla Inc. has started offering  consumers 84-month auto loans after Elon Musk said the carmaker would  ‚Äúhave to do something‚Äù about rising interest rates. The company now  includes seven-year loans as an option on its US order pages, after  previously offering loans as long as 72 months. While extending loan  terms can lower car buyers‚Äô monthly payments, consumers tend to pay more  in interest and face greater risk of owing more than their vehicle is  worth.

Tesla‚Äôs chief executive  officer has been a frequent critic of the Federal Reserve. Musk tweeted  in November that the central bank‚Äôs rate increases were ‚Äúmassively  amplifying the probability of a severe recession.‚Äù His predictions of  impending deflation haven‚Äôt yet panned out.‚ÄúWhen interest rates rise  dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car, because  the interest payments increase the price of the car,‚Äù Musk said during  Tesla‚Äôs July 19 earnings call. ‚ÄúSo we have to do something about that.‚Äù

While  84-month auto loans have been gaining in popularity, the trend slowed  early this year, according to credit-reporting company Experian. Roughly  34% of new vehicles loans in the first quarter were longer than six  years, down from about 38% a year ago. Tesla delivered a record 466,140  vehicles during the three months that ended in June but has sold fewer  cars than it‚Äôs produced each of the last five quarters. The shares  plunged after Musk said on this week‚Äôs call that the company will have  to keep lowering prices if interest rates continue to rise.",1564,Tesla ,1

I started trading pennystocks until I learned about option trading. I had little to no money I could deposit. But I put in 100 and started learning spreads on AMC, and would then buy AMC stock (back when it was 3 dollars)  with my earnings. I eventually got enough premium to buy 100 shares. I started selling calls on it.

Then AMC rose and I didn't have a call on it so I made my major win at the time. Lost all of it trading like shit except 300. Decided to give up option trading and YOLO'd the rest on 2 AAPL FD's. Apple randomly announced they were increasing phone manufacturing and I made 900 dollars over night.

Then pandemic happened. I knew it was coming so I cut all my living costs down. I started cooking at home more and living like a hermit saving a shit load of money because my job paid me to not work for 2 months (was fucking based). So I deposited all my government money into my brokerage except the amount of my car payment. I stopped trading like shit.

The rest is history.

Also, when I can I put 100 into my Webull account each pay period. I haven't been doing that lately but I do put 10 dollars into every brokerage I seriously trade on each week.

61931,157t0vr,"Serious question, how did you get the funding to start trading stocks?",2023-07-23,"I just want to put in my .02c. The first thing you can do is get out of debt. What good is an investment in anything that yields +% if you're spending -% on debt? Little Johnny has $1000 in cc debt at 29.99% interest, but he invests $1000 in stock that yields 10%. Little Johnny now has 19.99 interest rate, but that's compounding, so he's losing his $1000 investment on a daily basis. So there's rule 1, get out of debt. Things like a real estate mortgage are a necessary debt for most folks who want ""the american dream"" but you must know, the real dream is being free to travel, buy, and do whatever you wish. As long as you have debt, you're not free. If you're a renter, you're paying 100% interest rate.

The second thing you do is stop buying what you don't need. Seriously, a look back at your life from a hospital bed or a city park bench as you feed the pigeons will yield glimpses of the stuff you owned and the stuff that owned you, or the things you ""got"" to collect and share with others and enjoyed that didn't hold you down along the way. If you're a gamer, turn your game hobby into investing. Learn short trading. Spend that time investing, then at the gym. Leave the gaming behind and ""level up"" your personal finances. Pass up a cup of coffee in the coffee shop. If you have a Schwab account, you can buy fractional shares of SPY products for $5 min increments. A cup of overpriced coffee can also buy you $5 worth of tsla, tsll, etc. Me personally, a glass of water as I watch my $5 grow is worth a hell of a lot more.

And if you feel like gambling, which is literally all the market really is, gamble $100 on some inverse leveraged stocks like SQQQ, DUST, or REW. When (not if) the market flips negative, these historically shoot to the moon. Don't put all your eggs in this basket, it will Enron you if you're not careful. But this can has been kicked down the street for so long it's turned into a flaming hot bubble of a turd that will explode greatly and cause many if not most of the people reading this to wish they invested in more gaming devices and bottles of whiskey.

The $260 per share I got was pre-split, and Tesla went on an epic run, where I could have made life changing money if I held on.
