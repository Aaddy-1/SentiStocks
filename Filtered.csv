# **Jason Zweig Your Money and Your Brain**

-	Neuroeconomics
  - A monetary loss or gain causes a biological change that has profound physical effects on the body
  - Neural activity of someone making money in investments are indistinguishable from someone high on cocaine
  - After 2 repetitions of a stimulus, the human brain automatically, unconsciously, and uncontrollably expects a 3 repetition
  - Once people conclude that an investment return is predictable, their brains respond with alarm if the pattern is broken
  - Financial loss is processed in the same areas where we respond to mortal danger
  - Anticipating a gain and actually receiving it are expressed in different areas. Helps explain why money does not buy happiness
  - Expecting both good and bad events is often more intense than experiencing them
-	Greed
  - There is only one sure thing on Wall Street. And this is there are NO sure things
  - Lightning seldom strikes twice
  - Lock up your &quot;Mad Money&quot; and throw away the key. If you can&#39;t stop yourself from gambling in the market, then limit the amount
  - Control your cues. Turn off CNBC
  - Think twice before making any decisions. Calm yourself down
-	Prediction
  - Our incorrigible search for patterns leads us to assume that order exists where there is non
  - Whenever you are confronted with anything random, you WILL search for patterns in it
  - People hate randomness
  - If a reward is big enough, it will carry a long-lasting memory that is difficult to break. This is why chart analysts get into trouble because they think they &quot;got it&quot;
  - Investors have a recency bias ‚Äì what has happened they think will continue to happen, even if it is unpredictable. This causes investors to think that a bull market will continue and a bear market will also. This also causes them to buy the hottest mutual funds
  - Control what you can in the market ‚Äì don&#39;t look for the next Google
    - Expectations ‚Äì set realistic goals
    - Risk ‚Äì ask not how much you can gain, but also how much you can lose
    - Readiness ‚Äì think twice
    - Expenses ‚Äì keep them low
    - Commissions ‚Äì keep them low too
    - Taxes ‚Äì don&#39;t day trade, you get hit with short term taxes
    - Yourself ‚Äì don&#39;t try to predict
  - Don&#39;t try to predict the market ‚Äì DCA is a good strategy to prevent this
  - Most mutual fund managers fail to beat the market. Answer to this is to DCA into index mutual funds
  - Correlation is not causation
  - Take a break ‚Äì if you take a break, it resets your &quot;gamblers fallacy&quot; IE ‚Äì a coin is flipped 7 times and comes up heads 7 times in a row, the next flip is &quot;due&quot; for a tail.
  - Don&#39;t obsess ‚Äì if owning stocks is a long-term project for you, then following changes constantly is a very, very bad idea.
-	Confidence
  - Create a &quot;too hard&quot; pile. Know what you don&#39;t know.
  - Measure 2x cut 1x. Have an overconfidence discount of 25% so if a stock according to your valuation is worth between $40-60. Make it $30-45.
  - Don&#39;t get stuck on your own companies&#39; stock
  - Diversification is the best defense
-	Risk
  - Take a time out. Do not buy or sell an investment on the spur of the moment
  - When the price drops, so does risk.
  - Try to prove yourself wrong. Listen to another person&#39;s opinion
  - Know yourself and your risk tolerance
-	Surprise
  - If everyone knows something. It is already embedded in the price of the stock
  - High hopes can cause big trouble
-	Regret
  - Expecting regret often hurts worse than experiencing it
  - The more you can automate your investing, the better
  - Face your loss.
  - If you have a truly diversified portfolio, then you will guarantee yourself, by definition, that some of your assets will do well while some will do badly. You have to look at the whole portfolio
  - Don&#39;t chase hot sectors or stocks. The cure for chasing is to rebalance. Decide on a number and stick with it
  - Rebalancing over the long-term increases returns and lowers risks. It is buying low and selling high
-	Happiness
  - If you earn enough cash to live on. Then more money won&#39;t make you happier
  - Know that money is a means, not an end in itself
-	Summary
  - Take a global view. Look at total net worth, not changes in each holding
  - Hope for the best but expect the worst. Diversifying can keep you from panicking during bad times which will occur
  - Investigate before you invest. A stock isn&#39;t just a price. It is a company
  - Never say always. Never put more than 10% of your investments into a single stock
  - Know what you don&#39;t know.
  - The past is not the prologue. What goes up must come down and what goes way up usually comes down with a crunch. Never buy an investment because it is going up. Smart investors buy low and sell high
  - If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Anyone who offers a high return at low risk is probably a fraud
  - Costs are killers. Trading costs eat up your profits
  - Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread out between US, foreign, bonds, and cash. It is not a good idea to invest heavily in industries that your job is tied too. If you lose your job, your stock would be likely to fall also.

Elon Musk saw this in one of the slack channels

https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/031/634/guy-fired-over-meme-job-work-post-facebook-cody-hidalgo-fb.png

And he replied to it with a giant wall of text basically saying that he's 44 billion dollars in debt, made a bunch of sacrifices, and the employees are the ones making money.

But that's not all.

Elon Musk now has been going into bathrooms now and if he see's someone sitting in on the stalls, he pops his head over to talk to them about their projects in order to make sure they aren't pooping longer than necessary and stealing company time.

The meme seems to really gotten under his skin.

after Elon started doing it he bragged to mark zuckerburg about it, but then mark sent him this meme

https://i.imgflip.com/77us2q.jpg context


In the early days of facebook Mark Zuckerburg would wander into the company bathrooms and if he noticed someone sitting down in the stalls he would pop his head over and try to talk to them about their projects. Or if he was taking a poop he would host an emergency meeting and he would tell them to come over and pop their head over the stall to talk it out.

Everyone just went along with it because it was either YOLO SILICON VALLEY LMAO or they were just too intimidated.

That all stopped when Michael Moritz, legendary silicon valley investor, and one of Facebook biggest early investors and shareholders, was at the campus doing research for leading a 2nd round of funding. He was doing diligence all day and at one point had to poop and that's when Zuckerburg popped his head over with a smile to ask how's the diligence coming along.

Michael Moritz, not one to mince words, was apoplectic. 'GET THE FUCK OUT HERE YOU IDiiOT LIZARD LOOKING FUCKER.' Mark Zuckerburg nervously tried to laugh it off and persisted, because he really loved intimate poop conversations 'Aw c'mon Michael, it's silicon valley'. Zuckerburg then withdrew after Moritz flung his cellphone into his eye socket. 

30 minutes later, Mark was in a very import meeting (where he banned questions about his black eye) when Moritz walked into the conference room. 'Everyone except Mark Zuckerburg, OUT'. As intimidated as they were of Zuckerburg, at the time Moritz was the bigger deal, and they all scurried out of the room.

Zuckerburg, however, is not one to be intimated by anyone. Not the Winkewoz twins, not Eduardo Savarn, not Peter Thiel, and not one of his biggest shareholder Michael Moritz. Zuckerburg passionately defended his practice, but Michael Moritz was having none of that. Moritz told him that it was a ticking PR and HR nightmare, and threatened to pull out of leading the 2nd round of funding if Mark continued, which would have been a catastrophe for the company.

Zuckerburg pretended to arbitrate 'Ok fine, but you need to give me a good reason, because if it were normal, there would be no problem'.

Moritz was flabberghasted at this response. Was this a serious question? He answered with the most obvious answer 'Because.... it's not FUCKING NORMAL'.

Unknown to Moritz, Zuckerburg had guessed a conversation like this would happen as soon as he was kicked out of the toilet stall, and began formulating a strategy to counter Moritz demands. Zuckerburg knew that Moritz would have all the leverage, but Zuckerburg was a master strategist.

Zuckerburg went for the pounce. 'Okay, I'll lets write out an agreement, in writing I'll rescind the policy because it's not normal'. Moritz was dumbfounded, but he was used to being dumbfounded by eccentric tech founders, afterall he was also an early investor in Apple, and he still found Zuckerburg tame compared to Steve Jobs. Moritz had a long day of work so they signed the agreement so that he could go back to doing his due diligence.

When Moritz left, a broad grin spread across Zuckerburg's face. "" 'Not Normal' eh? "" Zuckerburg said with a menacing laugh. Ever since then, Mark Zuckerburg has been on a life-long crusade to normalize poop conversations.

He had a checklist of what he needed to accomplish in order to realize this. His advisors would tell him it's impossible, but one by one Zuckerburg checked off the list. From normalizing smart phone use on the toilet (actually a collaboration between Mark Zuckerburg and Steve Jobs), to trusting Mark with their private photos, to normalizing people giving up their internet browsing privacy.

In 2015, Zuckerburg knew he would hit a wall, having people watch you while you poop was still too much of a leap. That's when Zuckerburg decided to buy Occulus, and eventually shift his company towards virtual reality. If he could coax people into having life-like conversations while they were pooping in a virtual reality, then doing it in the real world wouldn't be too big of a leap.

Do you read facebook or instagram while you're pooping? Ever consider what urges you to do that? It's not your personal preference, it's by Mark Zuckerburg's design.

Zuckerburg only has 3 more boxes to check off before poop conversations are normalized.

Mark Zuckerburg wants to watch you poop.

Are you going to let him?

EDIT, UPDATE

I just got this in my DM. 

>I am a ex Facebook worker. Everything you said rings true. I speak to you at the risk of consequences for breaking my NDA. When I was at Facebook I was involved in a program called Project PooPal. Mark Zuckerburg was planning on Meta entering the exploding tele-therapy space, but targeting people who are not ready to talk to an actual person. You talk to a virtual reality therapist who responds with what is described as the greatest AI (though whatever you tell it, it only responds with 'wow, tell me more'). The thing is, the virtual reality assistant has a striking resemblance to Mark Zuckerburg himself. But the most damning aspect is that it's supposed to used only when you're pooping. This feature is described as optional, though uses the most advanced AI for your phone camera to check if you're actually on a toilet, and if not, says 'It looks like you're not pooping. Please start pooping and try again'. I always wondered what is the purpose and origin of the project. Now I know.",6213

This is no ordinary rally - it's a turbocharged, full-throttle ride that's making gravity jealous.

The sheer electric energy that's buzzing through the market right now is palpable. Investors are no longer simply watching - they are part of a phenomenon, dancing to the rhythm of rising digits and swelling portfolios. The skeptics are being left in the dust, squinting at the rocketing trajectory that's lighting up the financial night sky.

Wall Street is spinning. Analysts, clutching their tried-and-trusted textbooks, are witnessing a stock chart that seems to be making a mockery of conventional wisdom. But Tesla has never been about the conventional, has it? It's been about the extraordinary, the futuristic, the game-changing.

Congratulations are in order for the early birds and the stalwart believers. This is your victory parade - but not in slow motion, rather in ludicrous speed, around the circuits of the market's grand prix. Mr. Market, standing on the sidelines, can't help but nod in approval, realizing that Tesla's ascent is not just a surge, but a statement.

The message is clear: the future is electric, and it's happening right now. Tesla's stock isn't just defying gravity; it's etching a trail for the world to follow - a trail lit by the sparks of innovation, sustainability, and relentless ambition. So here's to the ride of our lives - may it continue to electrify, inspire, and, above all, accelerate!",1582

Until the Quest2 it was a very niche market. And as such ac chicken or the egg when it came to software developers. They are the key to adoption.  That said Apple has been on top of 3D and VR for decades. Their Safari browser - even the shortlived on that ran on Windows - supported 3D and VR a long time ago.   What is fascinating about their $3499 ""Spatial Computer"" is that it is NOT for gaming although they clearly are supporting Steam and the Unity Engine.  What is fascinating is the full Apple desktop experience - migrated to experiential 3D support - apps and all. This is an evolution just as graphics from text was an evolution. And people at that time argued why do I need it? Of course once the tech was ubiquitous there was no going back.  

Now the payoff.  Take an photo realistic avatar and great AI (in the M2 chip) and why do I need a mouse and keyboard for many functions?

i for instance would prefer the ring on my right hand and the button\[s\] on the left side of the ring, resulting in a comfortable resting position for my thumb, only using it to sometimes select. a small jewel could be placed on the real ring, acting as the point of origin for the AR laser pointer. now if we can point, scroll and click efficiently inside AR, we might have a pretty useful air mouse for maximally enjoying the fluidity of the vision pro's AR experience.",986

And everyone posting content is doing it for free! Or in the case of ads PAYING THEM TO.

So, what's going wrong? A site that basically serves just links and text isn't that costly to operate. It's not even search, it's just a forum for fuck sakes. Where is all the money being wasted??",535
8060,145qc96,CEO forecasts lack of profitability pre-IPO,2023-06-10 04:24:25,"Imo Reddit is really profitable in an advertising sense. A lot of people go to Reddit and stumble upon it by just using google. 

The Reddit ads representative I spoke to seemed very enthusiastic about how Reddit is starting to always show up for queries instead of some dinky SEO health line article. 

With that being said, the profitability for them lies in how advertisers can HAMMER specific niches. A problem with marketing suites like google, meta, Snapchat, etc, is that when you set your targeting up, a lot of impressions you get could just be blanks and wasted money. 

Reddit solves this problem. It‚Äôs like an advertisers dream. For example, you can legitimately advertise CBD to people on marijuana specific subreddits and ONLY marijuana specific subreddits. Or ai shit to aspiring entrepreneurs. Or trading platforms to people on r/wallstreetbets. This is even before they set up email matching with customer lists, user comment history, or other analytical data you/Reddit have. 

Keep in mind it‚Äôs different than just targeting interests, because people on certain subreddits are there for a certain reason. Someone is interested in CBD, scrolling through the CBD subreddit, boom here‚Äôs a CBD Ad. For reference, google only charges cost per click because the ad lands when someone googles something related. 

I don‚Äôt recall the exact number but google & meta make a large portion of their money because of advertising. Third Party apps don‚Äôt show ads, and that is the problem.",1493

* Fire the entire safety team (and everyone else)

I think corporates will train their own/purchased AI‚Äôs based on data sets either owned by them our bought for purpose.. and there‚Äôll be plenty of benefits into having a corporate champ that can put together all the data and draw conclusions, graphs and forecasts all based on data the company owns. You know how many people put their minds together to analyze data and create micro services for management, sales reps and the like. There‚Äôs plenty of other use such as in-house training courses, AI assistants to new hires and seniors. Basically fuck searching through 10 000 pages of knowledge-bases and courses. AI can standardize, it can correct and it can easily apply corporate governance. It can analyze performance based on metric data from Microsoft Viva, phone calls and sales etc. I guess my point is the data is already accessible and some poor soul probably goes through this shit on monthly reports showing KPI‚Äôs and sales performances etc.. but why not have one corporate AI that just swings this all the time and constantly keep track, give feedback, proposals etc. 

Then I think there will be companies manufacturing employee AI‚Äôs, basically training them for a specific role, could be a nurse, could be an IT operations person, could be a support agent, or any type of service job really. Now incorporate a bit of PAM & IAM for regulation purposes and to give the AI ways of executing tasks. It has the knowledge, it has the access to a variety of commands it can execute, it has the possibility to have a dialogue and troubleshoot, why wouldn‚Äôt it work? These little humanlike service AI‚Äôs will then be sold to companies, managed, trained and improved by its original makers. 

AI is also going to become a part of people‚Äôs everyday life‚Äôs, like it or not with smart homes, alarm systems, personal assistants.. you either get tech savvy or get left behind.

18894,146ywtf,The tech industry is in a AI bubble,2023-06-11 16:55:04,"I can't really argue that there are some overvaluations happening as a result of the hype. 

But it's pretty clear you don't understand the power of LLMs even a little. I can't say if the net jobs lost/gained will be positive or negative, but 300 million jobs totally changed, enhanced, or degraded by LLMs is very conservative.

The legal field will be one of the first to change. Just because some idiot asked chatGPT (a model trained for very general purposes, with no guarantee that any legal code or case law are even in the training set) about legal stuff and blindly trusted it means exactly nothing. I know of at least one company currently building an attributive LLM, ie a model trained on general purpose language, and then provide sources either from it's training set or database that support what it says. Imagine a legal assistant that can take a verbal description of a case or any situation, and spit out advice and information, for any jurisdiction, footnoted perfectly with sections of the law, relevant cases, sections of the contract being disputed, whatever helps make the case. Imagine this legal assistant can do this for any legal question every 5 seconds. 

The job of lawyer is unlikely to disappear any time soon, but it will allow each lawyer to do 10 times the amount of work they did previously, at least. If the demand for legal services doesn't rise at the same pace as the cost to provide services tanks, many of the jobs will disappear and the wealth will concentrate upward to the few, lucky lawyers still operating with the help of LLMs.

That is just one example. Slight modifications and wrappers around the engine that is LLM technology will soon popup specialized to a variety of fields. What is possible with the technology we have even today, with no further advancements, will only be known when people start putting different components together in creative ways, but is obviously great.

That being said, it is difficult to know which company will strike the first huge success here and become the next Google of LLMs. It is possible that company has not even been founded yet, and likely they aren't available for the public to invest in. NVDA will do well selling shovels, but they aren't going to strike gold like a small number of software companies will.

Yes, it's almost 2 Hours - But it's keyed towards Taiwanese commercial buyers, so not a lot of marketing fluff like you see with a new Nvidia gaming card release.

And if you don't get it after watching this, I suggest you go full tilt into NVDA puts - We need someone to help fuel our profits.

For the record, I think almost 90% of the stock market is an overvalued joke that will collapse when student loan payments resume but I'm still dumping $ into NVDA.

Watch the goddamn video. Jensen Huang is literally holding a computer in his hands that can perform 1 Exaflops of calculations.

Does anyone even comprehend how utterly ridiculous that is? That's a BILLION times a BILLION, or for the visually inclined:

**Every time you say, ""One-One Thousand"" the NVDA DGX can perform 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 mathematical calculations.**

***EVERY SECOND***\*\*.\*\*

Even companies that have zero interest in AI will buy these chips to replace entire Data Centers. You can replace massive, energy consuming supercomputers with NVDA GPU stacks that are a fraction of the size. Less heat, less cooling, less space.

Companies lose billions on heat and space - Why else do you think they keep coming up with crazy ways to solve the heat, space issues.

Whether it's building server farms in frozen tundra's to combat heat buildup, or companies like Google trying to save space by loading servers onto ships that would just float idly off the coast.

Now instead of buying a goddamn barge, loading it with servers, and floating it down the Mississippi Delta, you just call up NVDA and order a compact God-machine that has 300 interconnected GPUS, paired with 144 **TERABYTES** of memory, that you can stuff into a large closet. GG

18964,146ywtf,The tech industry is in a AI bubble,2023-06-11 16:55:04,"People act as if AI is something new. Computer scientists have been working on this for decades. 

Generative AI is sort of a phenomenon of a critical mass in hardware finally being achieved that is for the first time making generative AI doable at a reasonable cost and scale. It‚Äôs a cool new application that people can experience first hand.

But what do you call facial recognition that Facebook has had for like ten years? How about credit card software that knows based on your spending history whether with 98% likelihood it is you making a purchase? Is that not also AI?

The reason every company is talking AI on earnings calls and in marketing materials is simply because they have to appear as if they are on the cutting edge. It doesn‚Äôt matter what it is, they all follow each other. There‚Äôs nothing new about it and it‚Äôs a pattern that repeats over and over and over again.

This is what I think is getting lost in the debate about whether there‚Äôs an AI bubble. The more compelling hardware and applications become the greater the investment in it will be. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that nvda chips were used for video games then crypto mining and now for generative AI- as a new development progresses more and more applications of it take hold. I expect new and better application of generative AI to be developed. But I also expect additional uses of GPUs to be developed. We‚Äôre seeing this now with AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, and much more. And it‚Äôs only getting started.

Think back to when Intel chips reached a similar tipping point around the mid nineties. What happened? You saw all sorts of unrelated applications of the technology- gaming, productivity, learning, communication, etc. What we are seeing now with Nvidia and a couple other chip makers is a similar tipping point that is going to usher in a sea change. I think it‚Äôs very likely development of applications that tap into this power is going to ramp up exponentially and it‚Äôs very possible Nvidia will eventually become the most valuable company in the world. Yes, others are also producing compelling hardware- Apple, AMD, Google, but each of those are at a disadvantage to Nvidia. But there will be lots of winners in this new field and I think a lot of amazing research is going to come over the next decade.

To me it‚Äôs a lot like when they finally figured out the Bessemer process and then in ensuing years all sorts of unrelated things took off- railroads, bridges, high rise buildings, etc. which themselves were transformative. People aren‚Äôt realizing that a lot of the crazes we‚Äôve seen recently are directly related to GPU development enabling them.

But labeling it all as AI is very misleading. It‚Äôs probably more accurate to call the overall phenomenon something else. It‚Äôd be like calling the Industrial Revolution ‚Äúa rail bubble‚Äù.",2829

I think it will take them some time yet to come down off this high.    


I'm not sure how we should gauge when the business cadre will suddenly realize AI isn't pushing the massive profits they seem to expect... because that's when you want the puts for.

I‚Äôve been involved in fitness, both as an athlete and as a coach or trainer for a number of years.

PTON is a company with almost no real value to it. Ppl like their trainers but the hardware is really no different than any other bike. They need to keep ppl subscribed or there is no business. 

I called this beat down at the start of the pandemic when it went public and everyone thought it was going to the moon. They started giving ppl cheap subscriptions to buy the bike. The churn was going to be real and the bikes would get turned into expensive shirt racks. It happens all the time with anything at home fitness. Some become hard core but most ppl require others to stay motivated on track. 

The key moment for me was when they refused to admit any fault when their treadmill killed a kid. They basically blamed the kid and parents for not using it correctly. Hubris is a huge red flag. 

Next they came out and said they wouldn‚Äôt need any more capital raises and then less than a month later they came out with a cap raise. They were either lying or too incompetent to know. Either way it‚Äôs a red line to cross. The entire board, CEO and CFO deserved to be fired for that before the news even broke. 

The key for any value to be extracted from PTON is for someone like maybe Apple to come in and buy them up, likely with the caveat that certain high level trainers stay on for a certain period with the promise of profit sharing, a la Messi.",1454

Of course there would be a huge support for Tesla with a  culture like this one.

Mining companies like Glencore founded by Belgian ""traders"" name Marc Rich - literally Rich was his last name and he died in 2013 right around the same time it started becoming public knowledge that Congolese children were being exploited and trafficked into mining cobalt for the electric car industry so companies like Tesla and CEO's like Elon Musk could continue benefitting from the age old tradition of robbing Africans blind, started way back with King Leopold II going right into the Congo, declaring the territory and resources and entire people as his own like a mad God King Butcher and he ends up massacring millions of innocent men, women, and children mostly for resisting his rule.

The King was from Belgium, didn't give up the land and died a terrible tyrant with a permanent legacy as long as Glencore continues mining operations in the Congo and exploiting the descendants of the SURVIVORS of tyranny. 

Think about it, you have a bunch of Congolese families growing up in a mining zone that once was a lush and beautiful wilderness landscape teeming with exotic animals and birds and flora and fauna, natural water that was safe to drink and children were able to travel and explore and grow and move beyond their borders.

Now it's a mining colony filled with imported mercenary groups, Tech companies, mining conglomerates, Chinese dictatorship controlled military industrial complex NORINCO is setting up a base officially now. You have White Supremacy and racism to thank for the destruction of the Congo and their natural habitat, you have people getting extremely wealthy like Elon Musk and Tesla investors and Glencore participants all the same getting rich while covering up their lunacy with religions and fantasy based misinformation keeping innocent Congolese children from growing up healthy and happily, from offering them the same opportunities Marc Rich's parents attempted to offer him when they ""escaped"" from the Nazi's only to raise one of the worst ones of them all in the end it turns out no matter how hard you run from Nazi's you can't escape their grooming techniques, can't get passed the broken economic system that seems to enable a version of human beings beyond the rest with cultures all over the world united in weird cringeworthy holidays that celebrate fat white bearded blue eyed men dressed in red, or celebrate racist dictator tyrants that are long since dead and buried but still we honor their memory by keeping gigantic statues of them around and refusing to label them in the history books for what they truly were..",3113

Those trucks are just so much more user friendly than any other vehicle on the market. Their design just blows away the competition. To have the convenience of a trunk, side compartments all while keeping the open bed of a truck just makes so much sense.

I fully agree, they missed last year's sales expectations by just a handful of cars. They came up with an in-house solution for a critical part that was backlogged in Germany slowing production. So production is likely moving ahead. It feels like they are on a similar path as Tesla, they had years where no one ever thought they would pass 100k cars produced, and now they are making hundreds of thousands a quarter.

The bad competition has filed for bankruptcy, so fewer players move the funds from the failures and into the credible companies. They make high quality vehicles that are spreading in popularity.

Div Yield growth rate is 2x the mean, currently sitting at about 10%. It seems to me that some investors are getting more comfortable putting their cash into the equity market as the headline inflation is making its way to FED's goal of 2%. These investors are optimistic that the Fed will pivot from raising rates soon, which is good for the overall market. Though the S&P 500 has made some progress this year, it's lacking market breadth as the majority of the gains are attributable to the big names i.e., APPL, META, NVDA, and so forth.

""Every now and then, a macro event drives stocks into mars, with an army of valuation decriers.

Generative dotcom technology is fundamentally rewriting our economy.

You need an overvalued dotcom stock to make your dotcom model.

You need an overvalued dotcom stock to run your dotcom model.

You need an overvalued dotcom stock to run someone else's dotcom model.

Literally any time you see a company mention generative dotcom technology, which is gonna be every single company, they're basically announcing to the world they are giving the overvalued dotcom stock money.

There is not a single overvalued dotcom stock chip available right now. They are all accounted for the next two years.

This is based on current perception.

There's something very important in dotcom technology that you need to remember, and that is how when models get larger, they have demonstrated learning abilities that the developers did not specifically teach.

The potential for winner take all outcome is ENORMOUS with dotcom technology. FANG is fighting for their lives right now. It is not just Google.

If you are concerned about a ban on dotcom technology, know that it contributes only 20% of revenue for the overvalued dotcom stock, and there is no way it won't try to smuggle this overhyped tech at higher prices. /s Those future chips are already sold.

If you are concerned about insider sales, remember that Moderna insiders also sold all the way up, many too early.

Just like Moderna, the overvalued dotcom stock boldly gambled on an unproven technology, and the world is primed.

But the overvalued dotcom stock is not Moderna. There is no demand cliff coming.

Human species have begun building the ultimate human unchained by mortal meat, a god.

Its organs are the overvalued dotcom stock cards. TAM of divinity is infinity.

The overvalued dotcom stock is not 4090. The overvalued dotcom stock is gh200.

Stop listening to doomers on debt or recession. There is once in human history story playing out right now.""",2050

It may an be educated and thought out trade but still highly speculative. 

Due to factors like time decay and how the price of tesla is based on support/resistance of highly psychological number barriers (ie 175, 200 etc) youd be better off imo hypothetically:

10 contracts expiring in 90 days totaling 20k
But jnstead buying

X amount contracts 
-at the same strike 
-as far out of time as possible. 
This will more mimic a bearish view while worrying about theta too much

33615,148tol9,To all those think NVDA will fall,2023-06-14 00:16:41,"The problem is not that NVDA doesn't have a viable product, or that NVDA doesn't have one of the biggest moats in the history of technomoats. The issue is that their valuation leaves them precariously overexposed to a market drop.

Look at Intel in the years 1999 - 2000. We would need a big market catalyst to drop the price quite a bit, but in such a case, they would slough like crazy.

Intel actually had a significantly (and relatively over time) lower PE ratio is 1999, https://www.fool.com/archive/dripport/1999/06/04/intel-ligent-valuation-drip-port-june-4-1999.aspx, but doubled in 2000 on the bubble, and then popped back down to 20 after the crash.

All the while, they had a solid tech moat. Making CPU chips that others couldn't make, and while all the other companies that were buying Intel chips either went bankrupt, or otherwise decreased demand, Intel survived due to incredible footwork in fast shifting winds. Well, and again, because they had the same moat that NVDA has now.

This isn't a call to stock up on NVDA puts. No clue how this market will go. Anyways, NVDA is a mature growth company. 

For all intents and purposes, NVDA is a company with its feet firmly planted, yet they have a barely realized market and 20 years of a head start. Nobody (in the business world at least) thought that graphics cards would ever be used by anyone besides glorified dungeons and dragons fans.

I'm not sure Nvidia even knew about the potential. You could say they were quite lucky, because they've developed these cards with one competitor who targeted cheap cards, while they targeted advancement while nobody was watching, which put them in the perfect position to dominate AI (again, who knew a GPU would be used for AI in 2000?). 

Spurred by crypto miners, they fleshed out the number systems they could use for computations. It's almost this perfect storm, and an insatiable desire to be the very best that has put them in the position they are in. I'm not talking about the market. I'm talking about them as a company which makes a product. They just keep coming up with the best solutions, that put them into positions to capitalize on unforeseen opportunity. 

Somebody must've had a good fortune cookie.

It's not necessarily the same thing as Intel.

But nonetheless, if the market turns, you better believe NVDA puts will print and somebody out there will probably gobble up a literal fortune.

Because anyways, Intel's AI processing is not that terrible compared to Nvidia. In fact, it's marginally cheaper to run a full AI training set as far as energy goes, just so... unbelievably slooooow compared.

But do we genuinely see a big drop happening? Do we actually have an incorrectly leveraged market right now? Or maybe, could investor choices change rapidly? For example, if war broke out and America was directly involved, would big time investors still want to keep as much money in this stock?

Honestly, what I see happening is a huge surprise on the earnings to come from here, so that the price to earnings ratio will be quickly justifi- well... less unjustifiable - back in the orbit of our solar system at least.

I don't care if I'm wrong either way prediction wise, other than to say, I like the tech, bro.

Will the price go down in the meantime? I wouldn't be surprised, but remember, the market can remain irrational far longer than you can remain solvent. Maybe some of that extrinsic rationale will become a bit more of a rational valuation.

They don't even own the factories - they rely on TSMC like everyone else, so they're bidding with Cloud Providers and that will eat their margins.

This stuff is so easy to make and software is portable, so everyone has it. Just look at AMD, Cloud TPUs (Google, AWS, Azure), Tesla FSD and D1, Apple ""bionic"" M1/M2 chips. [They're highly competitive](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-v4-mlperf-2-0-results).

Microsoft had a borderline monopoly on PCs when PCs were king. They were genuinely as important to society as people believed - they still ate shit during the dot com bubble.

Important product/company does not equate to being properly valued. There's a reason a company like Nvidia is riding this hype train, and the hype being there in the first place is deserving in some capacity, but that does not mean it should be worth over a trillion dollars. Such an obscene amount of money! Arguably no company should, but if you look at the other companies in the club, at least they make sense.

Even if you would counter with the fact that our ideas of what proper valuations are may be outdated (a P/E > 25 being the benchmark is extremely outdated and myopic) this is obviously a hype train. If you invested right now, you're probably betting more so on the idea that more people will keep buying than you are that it will continue to accumulate value, even if those are ""technically"" the same idea.

The only rebuttal I would accept is a comparison to Tesla, in the sense that people will be so bought into the idea of Nvidia being valuable that the actual valuation won't matter, even though it's absurd by every metric out there, and that people will just keep buying regardless of the valuations.

Touch screen issues, missing paint, missing features, interior paneling with gaps and some things just not installed at all. And Tesla is still having issues with these things

2: Teslas are just now starting to get onto the used car market, and the trend will only increase over the next few years. And with the requirement to buy a new battery, and with the previously mentioned quality issues, I suspect these will sell for much cheaper than when the original owners bought them. 

3: Although this secondary market may be great for the brand, it does nothing for Tesla‚Äôs bottom line. And because of their price-point for the poor quality and increased competition on the market, Tesla will indeed lose some of their original adopters to competitors with better quality and reliability.

1. Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory will stop production on the battery production line 1 period, and lay off employees.

2. Part of the reason is that production line 2 period will soon go into production to replace line 1 period.

3. At the same time, Model 3 and Model Y will use battery packs provided by Ningde Times, which also led to some of Tesla's battery production outsourcing to battery suppliers.

4. Tesla's approach is intended to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

38246,14cmbyj,"I aped into Peloton calls, your thoughts?",2023-06-18 14:50:32,"Oh boy.

Disclosure:  Peloton bike owner.

Peloton is a great product, but let's say things got  tight financially.  What is the easiest thing to cut out of my non-existent budget?  My Peloton subscription.

Peloton's current, and very recent, objective is a market pivot; selling an app to the poors, rather than a bike to the less poors \[households with 100-120k+ income\] They just recalled all of their standard models of their bikes, at likely significant cost.

Who are they competing against:  A pretty significant field.  Gym memberships, the bike you buy at Costco \[think it's called an Echelon\], shitty knock-offs of Peloton bikes aimed at the poors, Nordictrack, the outdoors \[free\], apps like Strava, free apps, etc.  Their brand name needs to be so desired by the poors that they're willing to pay for an app telling them to walk or run outside versus free apps.

We're currently in the summer, which is peloton's weakest time of the year.

I know about 20 other people who own pelotons, and the vast majority of them use it once per month.  They pay for a subscription because they either don't even think about it, or because they're so financially secure that they do not care.

In the summer time, I use it twice per week, and in the winter, I use it 2-4 times per week.

If I were Peloton I would try to sell a high quality fly-wheel stationary bike without a monitor that has a mount for a cell phone that poors could possibly afford; giving them access to the peloton content.  The quality of the pedaling is what actually sets apart Peloton from other stationary bikes.   This ties the sale of a product and a subscription which could generate income for their company, while simultaneously expanding their market base.  


Is Peloton a good product?  Yes.  But they're offering less content and shittier music to save money.

If I were to play the peloton game, which I wouldn't based on personal ""calm before the storm"" market sentiment, I would be buying stocks for the long term, not option trades.  I would purchase stocks somewhere between the end of July through mid-August, and probably sell by mid-February if I hadn't lost all of my money by then.

Your only hope is that peloton gets purchased by Amazon in your time frame. 

&#x200B;

Note:  None of this is financial research; just a sentiment and is from information I previously gathered, plus anecdotal evidence from Peloton's primary market base.  I don't really care if you take this as financial advice, just know that I'm a moron, and I don't know why people put the standard disclaimer in this.",2591

No, not the computer scientist, the platform named after her.

I was just reading up on the architecture the other weekend and the tech here is pretty profound, especially when you consider the power of the ARM chip in the combo platform. The focus here is around AI, but the platform is really fantastic for any kind of big data processing or high speed provisioning, which includes cloud platforms.

And the margins on this stuff are insane. WAY beyond Amazon, Google, Apple's or Microsoft's average margins... and NVDA has significant patents related to the platform which enable highly complex mathematical operations shortcuts, which is part of the reason AMD hasn't been able to ape RTX cores yet.

I take no pleasure in this reality. I think it's awful for consumers and it's going to drive CapEx and prices up, but the overall uplift on performance leaning into the next datacenter hardware refresh cycle, with or without generative AI (and that spending will occur with AI in mind), the platform is going to be too enticing for companies to shy away from it. The margins are high, but so is the relative uplift. 

Should it be this way? No.

Microsoft or Nvidia: A user is considering whether to place out-of-the-money (OTM) calls on Microsoft or Nvidia, suggesting these are popular stock options among the community‚Äã1‚Äã.

Biden and red days: There's a comment about President Biden declaring an end to ""red days"" (days when the stock market goes down)‚Äã1‚Äã.

Spotify: A user predicts a downturn for Spotify because the service is not working on their computer. This comment seems more humorous than serious, but it does show how personal experiences can influence trading decisions in this community‚Äã1‚Äã.

Market trend: A user has commented on the market going up by 10% in one day and people experiencing FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)‚Äã1‚Äã.

SQQQ: There's a discussion about the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF (SQQQ), with one user considering buying and holding it, despite others apparently having been ""burned"" by it in the past‚Äã1‚Äã.

Federal Reserve (""Fed""): There's a comment about the Federal Reserve possibly bluffing about hikes being over, with a prediction that the market will go up significantly‚Äã1‚Äã.

Palantir Technologies (PLTR): A quote from Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir Technologies, is mentioned. The quote refers to an increase in interest in the company‚Äã1‚Äã.

The common phrases and topics in this thread seem to revolve around specific stocks (Microsoft, Nvidia, Spotify, Palantir), ETFs (SQQQ), trading strategies (OTM calls, buy and hold), and current events affecting the market (Binance's situation, Federal Reserve's actions, market trends).",1919

40550,14c7cby,$AAPL,2023-06-18 01:17:03,"Up and down cycles are inevitable, just as Issac Newton once said, ""What goes up must come down"". Now, I don't mean that stocks are like gravity where it'll plummet back down to earth or to the core. But, stocks will inevitably come down, because people will want to pocket profits and reallocate assets as wise investors should (definitely doesn't extend to many of us here). That being said, for Aapl here's a list of bearish news I could list right now:

* **Recession fears:** EU nations (ie: Germany) and some other wealthier nation(s) are entering a technical recession (New Zealand). Thereby, demand for discretionary goods (iphones/macs/ipads) traditionally will go down. As lending/credit will inevitably tighten, government bailouts or supports can only go so far before they can't lend any further (Not sure about this argument tho...)
* **Sales Decline:** Certain segment of Apple products have been on the decline for the past few quarters, showing potential slowdown and worsening sales overall in the future
* **Inflation**, while people are pointing out that inflation is declining people have to remember, we are talking about 4% inflation rate on top of a 8%+ inflation rate last year during the month of May alone. Wages have not caught up with it, and this discrepancy seems to be only widening. Yes, were not having a wage death spiral like the 70's, but we're also seeing a bigger gap in wealth. People nowadays are now more selective in their spending, giving a feedback loop to potential increase of recession. As spending slows so will profits and revenues decline for companies across all discretionary markets (Apple falls into this).
* **Innovation**, Apple honestly, haven't really brought out any revolutionary products nor any new product(s) that can shake the whole market. Yes, they recently brought out that vision pro thing. But, at $3,500 how many people could really afford it just to ""try it out""? Furthermore, we've seen how META, MSFT, Google all have given their shot at this eyewear market. Realistically none of them have had much success, yes maybe Apple could actually change it. But, unlikely just cause of the rich history of failures with this attempt of a product. I remember back in the 2000's seeing a teacher showing us similar 1990's version of these visual digital eyewear that was to simulate ""a new world"". Doesn't work well and haven't even after 3 decades... It'll probably take 3-4 generations before it could take off, which means cash burn. Remember Meta was confident they could pull it off, but now they're clawing back on their spending on Metaverse, that's one of the main driver in why META rebounded.
* **Shareholders**, one of the least thought rationale why stocks decline. When a company such as Apple who have one of the largest or if not is the largest company in the world, shareholders will demand more and more out of it. This leads Aapl to one day face the same dilemma that oil companies now face. Oil companies in order to retain investors, have to return 50%+ on average of their gains back to their investors in the form of stock buybacks/dividends. While, there are a lot of reasons that differentiate between Aapl & oil companies in terms of industry demands (oil is a capital intensive market). It also acts as a good reminder that some of these oil titans of the 50-80's ended up having to return more and more over time to their shareholders in order to retain investors capital. These dividends/stock buybacks were things that Steven Jobs didn't really like overall, because he thought capital could be better/efficiently used by the company themselves. But, now Apple has gone down this road and gave out dividends and have increased their stock buybacks. When shareholders gets used to this, they won't take it kindly if Apple suddenly decreases it when it runs into a recession etc. So stock prices will come down significantly once Apple starts or slowdown stock repurchases/dividends.
   * Look at Disney for example, yes Disney too have a lot of other reasons that Apple doesn't share commonality of why their stock prices declined from the heights of the pandemic. But, one of the things I see common when reading articles and opinions by investors is the lack of dividends or stock repurchases. Hedge funds/fund managers who want safe and stable returns looks to purchase these cash cow companies because they give a good or relatively fair return in the form of dividends/stock buy backs. Once, Disney went down this road of no longer giving dividends. They started to waver after the height of the pandemic and with more and more disappointing earnings report compounding it. Shareholders patience have only so much before they decide to drop the stock, that once gave dividends or stock buy backs. It's the fallacy of *""once given, it's hard to go back""*.

Overall, these are my rationale why Apple could come down in the future, now these are just my opinions and shouldn't be used for any financial decisions. Also these are just the cons, I haven't listed any pros or any reasons why Apple could keep going up. There's both sides of the coins and honestly **Apple is a strong company**. I don't expect it to suddenly drop 20% in the span of a month. If that were to happen it'd have to be a recession on the scale of the GFC of 2008 or the great depression. But, just keep your toes on point and be mindful when making an investment/purchase. Do research and DD and hopefully it works out in the end.

**TLDR:** Why I think a decline in Apple stock prices is cause of the following: Overbought, recession fears, inflation, sales decline in certain segments of apple products, lack of innovations that can be used/afforded by a lot of consumers, and shareholders demand. Overall, Apple is a strong company, but must be wary of this overly positive market when there's a lot of downside risk to it.",5896

40585,14c7cby,$AAPL,2023-06-18 01:17:03,"TL/DR

apple doesn't innovate 
-they don't have to they improve what others do and implement it in a way only apple can 

people are afraid of recessions and inflation 
-doesn't matter apple users know it's expensive and they've been buying for decades, eventually they'll come around. after working in telecommunications for years i know what phone is always sold out for months prior to release and preorders are rolling in from all income brackets. they don't even care about china based supply chain issues i've had people wait for 4 months for their 14 pro. 

sales decline 
-they literally started a savings account and their software revenue and subscription revenue is increasing faster than iphone sales decline 

they're up so much people will sell out 
-yes that's what always happens, take some gains or buy in when it drops. 
----------------------

rambling: 

apple is pretty much near its intrinsic value right now imo. the only thing i think people truly underestimate is how little the market cares about what anyone thinks. people have been saying apple is overvalued since 2017 and they said after the covid crash that it's still overvalued after it rebounded a bit and yet here we are apple is still going up without mentioning AI even once. 

they said the same about costco and yet it keeps going up because people are willing to pay for that premium. the thing with apple is that it's ultimately a consumer staple company. you could just as easily buy berkshire stock and get pretty much good apple exposure and diversification into other sectors with less big tech downside risk.

the bear case of apple is always the same they're overbought and stopped innovating since the first iphone which is not even remotely close to true. 

they always show up late to the party with stuff ""android did first"" and yet they still sell because they either improve it or make it intuitive enough that people who are already in the ecosystem just get to use it like it's always been there. nobody is going to switch to android for a feature samsung and google pumped out to stay relevant in the phone market when they know they'll get the same thing with the apple quality approval a few years later and they just wait for it. 

people laughed at the iphone price back then, they laughed at the transparent mac, they said the vision pro is too expensive and all the tech review youtubers say it's a wonderful piece of technology only the fans and enthusiasts will buy. 

i disagree on that i think the vision pro is going to shatter all expectations and will sell better than expected, simply because most of the downsides that other headsets have, apple atleast has some form of solution and while not perfect it's still a new product for the ecosystem. and because i've been here long enough to know that people suck when it comes to being financially responsible so even low income earners will manage to get their hands on it even though they shouldn't. 

people have been saying microsoft is in a decline and it only goes down from there they have peaked and they're a boomer stock. suddenly microsoft establishes itself as AI trailblazer and keeps staying relevant and growing into all directions. the thing with valuation and big tech is that big tech doesn't work like ford or coca cola where old companies slowly hit their peak and then just use pricing power to increase dividends so old people don't sell the stock they've been holding and to offer a nice alternative during the times where big tech doesn't do much besides firing employees and find new ways to get more data out of customers to sell. 


as long as they're not grossly overpriced, in todays market probably around 200 per share you probably could just buy one per month as a savings plan and still get good money out of it even though it's probably going to pull back a bit during july. 

you could do what no one dares to do here and buy shares or calls with 1-2 years expiration and end up in the green. and if you lose then it's just the same outcome as anything else you've tried so far so the downside risk is status quo and the upside potential is making money for once. 

i'm not even a huge apple user or a fan of their hardware but i have to admit that it's a very well run business.",4282

 AAPL stock only goes up because Tim Cook secretly installed a 'reverse gravity' button in their headquarters. Every time the stock starts to dip, Tim just hits the button, and voila! The laws of gravity are defied, and the stock starts floating right back up. It's like having an anti-gravity superpower specifically designed for stocks.

1. Greed. Tim Cook retires and leaves the wrong person in charge‚Ä¶ A change in management to people who value trying to blow analysts predictions out of the water  every quarter‚Ä¶ Better wxplanation of what I‚Äôm saying - Most of the time apple comes in or beats the numbers however it never seems to be good enough‚Ä¶ current management doesn‚Äôt batt an eye, just stays the course‚Ä¶ Bean counter management could take over, fire 90% of the talent and cut quality standards a lot and achieve stellar $ results for several quarters‚Ä¶ long term results would be a major crash of the company with the bean counter management exiting with billion dollar parachutes leaving a Skelton. Ex: Apple buying an airline, apple buying Proctor and Gamble, Apple buying Quickrete so they could have AppleKrete concrete‚Ä¶ Apple buying up Home building companies‚Ä¶. Now you can have an apple house‚Ä¶. 

2. Apple looses focus and uses its huge cash pile to start buying anything and everything in an attempt to be a behemoth. Example: GE buying up companies that they had no idea how to run, operate long term‚Ä¶ AT&T buying Direct TV‚Ä¶ Westinghouse‚Ä¶. Any and all newspaper companies. Sure the internet killed them in the end but corporate greed, firing of skilled staff for inexperience, low wage workers so they could keep their golf club memberships was the hammer to the glass‚Ä¶ Our Grandfathers had their entire nest egg in these companies as they were the Apple of the day and lost tons‚Ä¶
